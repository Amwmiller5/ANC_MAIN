Latency optimization
This guide covers the core set of principles you can apply to improve latency across a wide variety of LLM-related use cases. These techniques come from working with a wide range of customers and developers on production applications, so they should apply regardless of what you're building – from a granular workflow to an end-to-end chatbot!

While there's many individual techniques, we'll be grouping them into seven principles meant to represent a high-level taxonomy of approaches for improving latency.

At the end, we'll walk through an example to see how they can be applied.

The seven principles
Process tokens faster.
Generate fewer tokens.
Use fewer input tokens.
Make fewer requests.
Parallelize.
Make your users wait less.
Don't default to an LLM.
You can use the friendly, catchy acronym PGIRPWD to remember these. (Processing, Generation, Input, Requests, Parallelize, Waiting, Don't)

1. Process tokens faster
Inference speed is probably the first thing that comes to mind when addressing latency (but as you'll see soon, it's far from the only one). This refers to the actual rate at which the LLM processes tokens, and is often measured in TPM (tokens per minute) or TPS (tokens per second).

The main factor that influences inference speed is model size – smaller models usually run faster (and cheaper), and when used correctly can even outperform larger models. To maintain high quality performance with smaller models you can explore:

using a longer, more detailed prompt,
adding (more) few-shot examples, or
fine-tuning / distillation.
Deep dive
Compute capacity & inference optimizations
2. Generate fewer tokens
Generating tokens is almost always the highest latency step when using an LLM: as a general heuristic, cutting 50% of your output tokens may cut ~50% your latency. The way you reduce your output size will depend on output type:

If you're generating natural language, simply asking the model to be more concise ("under 20 words" or "be very brief") may help. You can also use few shot examples and/or fine-tuning to teach the model shorter responses.

If you're generating structured output, try to minimize your output syntax where possible: shorten function names, omit named arguments, coalesce parameters, etc.

Finally, while not common, you can also use max_tokens or stop_tokens to end your generation early.

Always remember: an output token cut is a (milli)second earned!

3. Use fewer input tokens
While reducing the number of input tokens does result in lower latency, this is not usually a significant factor – cutting 50% of your prompt may only result in a 1-5% latency improvement. Unless you're working with truly massive context sizes (documents, images), you may want to spend your efforts elsewhere.

That being said, if you are working with massive contexts (or you're set on squeezing every last bit of performance and you've exhausted all other options) you can use the following techniques to reduce your input tokens:

Fine-tuning the model, to replace the need for lengthy instructions / examples.
Filtering context input, like pruning RAG results, cleaning HTML, etc.
Maximize shared prompt prefix, by putting dynamic portions (e.g. RAG results, history, etc) later in the prompt. This makes your request more KV cache-friendly (which most LLM providers use) and means fewer input tokens are processed on each request. (why?)
4. Make fewer requests
Each time you make a request you incur some round-trip latency – this can start to add up.

If you have sequential steps for the LLM to perform, instead of firing off one request per step consider putting them in a single prompt and getting them all in a single response. You'll avoid the additional round-trip latency, and potentially also reduce complexity of processing multiple responses.

An approach to doing this is by collecting your steps in an enumerated list in the combined prompt, and then requesting the model to return the results in named fields in a JSON. This way you can easily parse out and reference each result!

5. Parallelize
Parallelization can be very powerful when performing multiple steps with an LLM.

If the steps are not strictly sequential, you can split them out into parallel calls. Two shirts take just as long to dry as one.

If the steps are strictly sequential, however, you might still be able to leverage speculative execution. This is particularly effective for classification steps where one outcome is more likely than the others (e.g. moderation).

Start step 1 & step 2 simultaneously (e.g. input moderation & story generation)
Verify the result of step 1
If result was not the expected, cancel step 2 (and retry if necessary)
If your guess for step 1 is right, then you essentially got to run it with zero added latency!

6. Make your users wait less
There's a huge difference between waiting and watching progress happen – make sure your users experience the latter. Here are a few techniques:

Streaming: The single most effective approach, as it cuts the waiting time to a second or less. (ChatGPT would feel pretty different if you saw nothing until each response was done.)
Chunking: If your output needs further processing before being shown to the user (moderation, translation) consider processing it in chunks instead of all at once. Do this by streaming to your backend, then sending processed chunks to your frontend.
Show your steps: If you're taking multiple steps or using tools, surface this to the user. The more real progress you can show, the better.
Loading states: Spinners and progress bars go a long way.
Note that while showing your steps & having loading states have a mostly psychological effect, streaming & chunking genuinely do reduce overall latency once you consider the app + user system: the user will finish reading a response sooner.

7. Don't default to an LLM
LLMs are extremely powerful and versatile, and are therefore sometimes used in cases where a faster classical method would be more appropriate. Identifying such cases may allow you to cut your latency significantly. Consider the following examples:

Hard-coding: If your output is highly constrained, you may not need an LLM to generate it. Action confirmations, refusal messages, and requests for standard input are all great candidates to be hard-coded. (You can even use the age-old method of coming up with a few variations for each.)
Pre-computing: If your input is constrained (e.g. category selection) you can generate multiple responses in advance, and just make sure you never show the same one to a user twice.
Leveraging UI: Summarized metrics, reports, or search results are sometimes better conveyed with classical, bespoke UI components rather than LLM-generated text.
Traditional optimization techniques: An LLM application is still an application; binary search, caching, hash maps, and runtime complexity are all still useful in a world of LLMs.
Example
Let's now look at a sample application, identify potential latency optimizations, and propose some solutions!

We'll be analyzing the architecture and prompts of a hypothetical customer service bot inspired by real production applications. The architecture and prompts section sets the stage, and the analysis and optimizations section will walk through the latency optimization process.

You'll notice this example doesn't cover every single principle, much like real-world use cases don't require applying every technique.

Architecture and prompts
The following is the initial architecture for a hypothetical customer service bot. This is what we'll be making changes to.

Assistants object architecture diagram

At a high level, the diagram flow describes the following process:

A user sends a message as part of an ongoing conversation.
The last message is turned into a self-contained query (see examples in prompt).
We determine whether or not additional (retrieved) information is required to respond to that query.
Retrieval is performed, producing search results.
The assistant reasons about the user's query and search results, and produces a response.
The response is sent back to the user.
Below are the prompts used in each part of the diagram. While they are still only hypothetical and simplified, they are written with the same structure and wording that you would find in a production application.

Places where you see placeholders like "[user input here]" represent dynamic portions, that would be replaced by actual data at runtime.

Query contextualization prompt
Retrieval check prompt
Assistant prompt
Analysis and optimizations
Part 1: Looking at retrieval prompts
Looking at the architecture, the first thing that stands out is the consecutive GPT-4 calls - these hint at a potential inefficiency, and can often be replaced by a single call or parallel calls.

Assistants object architecture diagram

In this case, since the check for retrieval requires the contextualized query, let's combine them into a single prompt to make fewer requests.

Assistants object architecture diagram

Combined query contextualization and retrieval check prompt

Actually, adding context and determining whether to retrieve are very straightforward and well defined tasks, so we can likely use a smaller, fine-tuned model instead. Switching to GPT-3.5 will let us process tokens faster.

Assistants object architecture diagram

Part 2: Analyzing the assistant prompt
Let's now direct our attention to the Assistant prompt. There seem to be many distinct steps happening as it fills the JSON fields – this could indicate an opportunity to parallelize.

Assistants object architecture diagram

However, let's pretend we have run some tests and discovered that splitting the reasoning steps in the JSON produces worse responses, so we need to explore different solutions.

Could we use a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4? Maybe – but in general, open-ended responses from assistants are best left to GPT-4 so it can better handle a greater range of cases. That being said, looking at the reasoning steps themselves, they may not all require GPT-4 level reasoning to produce. The well defined, limited scope nature makes them and good potential candidates for fine-tuning.

"message_is_conversation_continuation": "True", // <-

"user_requesting_to_talk_to_human": "False", // <-
"enough_information_in_context": "True" // <-
"response": "..." // X -- benefits from GPT-4
}
This opens up the possibility of a trade-off. Do we keep this as a single request entirely generated by GPT-4, or split it into two sequential requests and use GPT-3.5 for all but the final response? We have a case of conflicting principles: the first option lets us make fewer requests, but the second may let us process tokens faster.

As with many optimization tradeoffs, the answer will depend on the details. For example:

The proportion of tokens in the response vs the other fields.
The average latency decrease from processing most fields faster.
The average latency increase from doing two requests instead of one.
The conclusion will vary by case, and the best way to make the determiation is by testing this with production examples. In this case let's pretend the tests indicated it's favorable to split the prompt in two to process tokens faster.

Assistants object architecture diagram

Note: We'll be grouping response and enough_information_in_context together in the second prompt to avoid passing the retrieved context to both new prompts.

Assistants prompt - reasoning
Assistants prompt - response

In fact, now that the reasoning prompt does not depend on the retrieved context we can parallelize and fire it off at the same time as the retrieval prompts.

Assistants object architecture diagram

Part 3: Optimizing the structured output
Let's take another look at the reasoning prompt.

Taking a closer look at the reasoning JSON you may notice the field names themselves are quite long.

"response_tone": "Validating and solution-oriented", // <-
"response_requirements": "Propose options for repair or replacement.", // <-
"user_requesting_to_talk_to_human": "False", // <-
}
By making them shorter and moving explanations to the comments we can generate fewer tokens.

"tone_out": "Validating and solution-oriented", // desired tone for response
"reqs": "Propose options for repair or replacement.", // response requirements
"human": "False", // whether user is expressing want to talk to human
}
Assistants object architecture diagram

This small change removed 19 output tokens. While with GPT-3.5 this may only result in a few millisecond improvement, with GPT-4 this could shave off up to a second.

Assistants object architecture diagram

You might imagine, however, how this can have quite a significant impact for larger model outputs.

We could go further and use single chatacters for the JSON fields, or put everything in an array, but this may start to hurt our response quality. The best way to know, once again, is through testing.

Example wrap-up
Let's review the optimizations we implemented for the customer service bot example:

Assistants object architecture diagram

Combined query contextualization and retrieval check steps to make fewer requests.
For the new prompt, switched to a smaller, fine-tuned GPT-3.5 to process tokens faster.
Split the assistant prompt in two, switching to a smaller, fine-tuned GPT-3.5 for the reasoning, again to process tokens faster.
Parallelized the retrieval checks and the reasoning steps.
Shortened reasoning field names and moved comments into the prompt, to generate fewer tokens.
Conclusion
You should now be familiar with the core set of principles you can use to improve latency in your LLM application. As you explore these techniques, always remember to measure where your latency is coming from, and test the impact of each solution your try. Now go make your application fly!
Optimizing LLMs for accuracy
How to maximize correctness and consistent behavior when working with LLMs
Optimizing LLMs is hard.

We've worked with many developers across both start-ups and enterprises, and the reason optimization is hard consistently boils down to these reasons:

Knowing how to start optimizing accuracy
When to use what optimization method
What level of accuracy is good enough for production
This paper gives a mental model for how to optimize LLMs for accuracy and behavior. We’ll explore methods like prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning. We’ll also highlight how and when to use each technique, and share a few pitfalls.

As you read through, it's important to mentally relate these principles to what accuracy means for your specific use case. This may seem obvious, but there is a difference between producing a bad copy that a human needs to fix vs. refunding a customer $1000 rather than $100. You should enter any discussion on LLM accuracy with a rough picture of how much a failure by the LLM costs you, and how much a success saves or earns you - this will be revisited at the end, where we cover how much accuracy is “good enough” for production.

LLM optimization context
Many “how-to” guides on optimization paint it as a simple linear flow - you start with prompt engineering, then you move on to retrieval-augmented generation, then fine-tuning. However, this is often not the case - these are all levers that solve different things, and to optimize in the right direction you need to pull the right lever.

It is useful to frame LLM optimization as more of a matrix:

Accuracy mental model diagram

The typical LLM task will start in the bottom left corner with prompt engineering, where we test, learn, and evaluate to get a baseline. Once we’ve reviewed those baseline examples and assessed why they are incorrect, we can pull one of our levers:

Context optimization: You need to optimize for context when 1) the model lacks contextual knowledge because it wasn’t in its training set, 2) its knowledge is out of date, or 3) it requires knowledge of proprietary information. This axis maximizes response accuracy.
LLM optimization: You need to optimize the LLM when 1) the model is producing inconsistent results with incorrect formatting, 2) the tone or style of speech is not correct, or 3) the reasoning is not being followed consistently. This axis maximizes consistency of behavior.
In reality this turns into a series of optimization steps, where we evaluate, make a hypothesis on how to optimize, apply it, evaluate, and re-assess for the next step. Here’s an example of a fairly typical optimization flow:

Accuracy mental model journey diagram

In this example, we do the following:

Begin with a prompt, then evaluate its performance
Add static few-shot examples, which should improve consistency of results
Add a retrieval step so the few-shot examples are brought in dynamically based on the question - this boosts performance by ensuring relevant context for each input
Prepare a dataset of 50+ examples and fine-tune a model to increase consistency
Tune the retrieval and add a fact-checking step to find hallucinations to achieve higher accuracy
Re-train the fine-tuned model on the new training examples which include our enhanced RAG inputs
This is a fairly typical optimization pipeline for a tough business problem - it helps us decide whether we need more relevant context or if we need more consistent behavior from the model. Once we make that decision, we know which lever to pull as our first step toward optimization.

Now that we have a mental model, let’s dive into the methods for taking action on all of these areas. We’ll start in the bottom-left corner with Prompt Engineering.

Prompt engineering
Prompt engineering is typically the best place to start**. It is often the only method needed for use cases like summarization, translation, and code generation where a zero-shot approach can reach production levels of accuracy and consistency.

This is because it forces you to define what accuracy means for your use case - you start at the most basic level by providing an input, so you need to be able to judge whether or not the output matches your expectations. If it is not what you want, then the reasons why will show you what to use to drive further optimizations.

To achieve this, you should always start with a simple prompt and an expected output in mind, and then optimize the prompt by adding context, instructions, or examples until it gives you what you want.

Optimization
To optimize your prompts, I’ll mostly lean on strategies from the Prompt Engineering guide in the OpenAI API documentation. Each strategy helps you tune Context, the LLM, or both:

Strategy	Context optimization	LLM optimization
Write clear instructions		X
Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks	X	X
Give GPTs time to "think"		X
Test changes systematically	X	X
Provide reference text	X	
Use external tools	X	
These can be a little difficult to visualize, so we’ll run through an example where we test these out with a practical example. Let’s use gpt-4-turbo to correct Icelandic sentences to see how this can work.

Prompt engineering for language corrections
We’ve seen that prompt engineering is a great place to start, and that with the right tuning methods we can push the performance pretty far.

However, the biggest issue with prompt engineering is that it often doesn’t scale - we either need dynamic context to be fed to allow the model to deal with a wider range of problems than we can deal with through simple context stuffing or we need more consistent behavior than we can achieve with few-shot examples.

Deep dive
Using long context to scale prompt engineering
So how far can you really take prompt engineering? The answer is that it depends, and the way you make your decision is through evaluations.

Evaluation
This is why a good prompt with an evaluation set of questions and ground truth answers is the best output from this stage. If we have a set of 20+ questions and answers, and we have looked into the details of the failures and have a hypothesis of why they’re occurring, then we’ve got the right baseline to take on more advanced optimization methods.

Before you move on to more sophisticated optimization methods, it's also worth considering how to automate this evaluation to speed up your iterations. Some common practices we’ve seen be effective here are:

Using approaches like ROUGE or BERTScore to provide a finger-in-the-air judgment. This doesn’t correlate that closely with human reviewers, but can give a quick and effective measure of how much an iteration changed your model outputs.
Using GPT-4 as an evaluator as outlined in the G-Eval paper, where you provide the LLM a scorecard to assess the output as objectively as possible.

Understanding the tools
So you’ve done prompt engineering, you’ve got an eval set, and your model is still not doing what you need it to do. The most important next step is to diagnose where it is failing, and what tool works best to improve it.

Here is a basic framework for doing so:

Classifying memory problem diagram

You can think of framing each failed evaluation question as an in-context or learned memory problem. As an analogy, imagine writing an exam. There are two ways you can ensure you get the right answer:

You attend class for the last 6 months, where you see many repeated examples of how a particular concept works. This is learned memory - you solve this with LLMs by showing examples of the prompt and the response you expect, and the model learning from those.
You have the textbook with you, and can look up the right information to answer the question with. This is in-context memory - we solve this in LLMs by stuffing relevant information into the context window, either in a static way using prompt engineering, or in an industrial way using RAG.
These two optimization methods are additive, not exclusive - they stack, and some use cases will require you to use them together to use optimal performance.

Let’s assume that we’re facing a short-term memory problem - for this we’ll use RAG to solve it.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
RAG is the process of Retrieving content to Augment your LLM’s prompt before Generating an answer. It is used to give the model access to domain-specific context to solve a task.

RAG is an incredibly valuable tool for increasing the accuracy and consistency of an LLM - many of our largest customer deployments at OpenAI were done using only prompt engineering and RAG.

RAG diagram

In this example we have embedded a knowledge base of statistics. When our user asks a question, we embed that question and retrieve the most relevant content from our knowledge base. This is presented to the model, which answers the question.

RAG applications introduce a new axis we need to optimize against, which is retrieval. For our RAG to work, we need to give the right context to the model, and then assess whether the model is answering correctly. I’ll frame these in a grid here to show a simple way to think about evaluation with RAG:

RAG evaluation diagram

You have two areas your RAG application can break down:

Area	Problem	Resolution
Retrieval	You can supply the wrong context, so the model can’t possibly answer, or you can supply too much irrelevant context, which drowns out the real information and causes hallucinations.	Optimizing your retrieval, which can include:
- Tuning the search to return the right results.
- Tuning the search to include less noise.
- Providing more information in each retrieved result
These are just examples, as tuning RAG performance is an industry into itself, with libraries like LlamaIndex and LangChain giving many approaches to tuning here.
LLM	The model can also get the right context and do the wrong thing with it.	Prompt engineering by improving the instructions and method the model uses, and, if showing it examples increases accuracy, adding in fine-tuning
The key thing to take away here is that the principle remains the same from our mental model at the beginning - you evaluate to find out what has gone wrong, and take an optimization step to fix it. The only difference with RAG is you now have the retrieval axis to consider.

While useful, RAG only solves our in-context learning issues - for many use cases, the issue will be ensuring the LLM can learn a task so it can perform it consistently and reliably. For this problem we turn to fine-tuning.

Fine-tuning
To solve a learned memory problem, many developers will continue the training process of the LLM on a smaller, domain-specific dataset to optimize it for the specific task. This process is known as fine-tuning.

Fine-tuning is typically performed for one of two reasons:

To improve model accuracy on a specific task: Training the model on task-specific data to solve a learned memory problem by showing it many examples of that task being performed correctly.
To improve model efficiency: Achieve the same accuracy for less tokens or by using a smaller model.
The fine-tuning process begins by preparing a dataset of training examples - this is the most critical step, as your fine-tuning examples must exactly represent what the model will see in the real world.

Many customers use a process known as prompt baking, where you extensively log your prompt inputs and outputs during a pilot. These logs can be pruned into an effective training set with realistic examples.

Fine-tuning process diagram

Once you have this clean set, you can train a fine-tuned model by performing a training run - depending on the platform or framework you’re using for training you may have hyperparameters you can tune here, similar to any other machine learning model. We always recommend maintaining a hold-out set to use for evaluation following training to detect overfitting. For tips on how to construct a good training set you can check out the guidance in our Fine-tuning documentation, while for how to prep and tune the hold-out set there is more info here. Once training is completed, the new, fine-tuned model is available for inference.

For optimizing fine-tuning we’ll focus on best practices we observe with OpenAI’s model customization offerings, but these principles should hold true with other providers and OSS offerings. The key practices to observe here are:

Start with prompt-engineering: Have a solid evaluation set from prompt engineering which you can use as a baseline. This allows a low-investment approach until you’re confident in your base prompt.
Start small, focus on quality: Quality of training data is more important than quantity when fine-tuning on top of a foundation model. Start with 50+ examples, evaluate, and then dial your training set size up if you haven’t yet hit your accuracy needs, and if the issues causing incorrect answers are due to consistency/behavior and not context.
Ensure your examples are representative: One of the most common pitfalls we see is non-representative training data, where the examples used for fine-tuning differ subtly in formatting or form from what the LLM sees in production. For example, if you have a RAG application, fine-tune the model with RAG examples in it so it isn’t learning how to use the context zero-shot.
All of the above
These techniques stack on top of each other - if your early evals show issues with both context and behavior, then it's likely you may end up with fine-tuning + RAG in your production solution. This is ok - these stack to balance the weaknesses of both approaches. Some of the main benefits are:

Using fine-tuning to minimize the tokens used for prompt engineering, as you replace instructions and few-shot examples with many training examples to ingrain consistent behaviour in the model.
Teaching complex behavior using extensive fine-tuning
Using RAG to inject context, more recent content or any other specialized context required for your use cases
Using these tools to improve language translation
Now you should have an appreciation for RAG and fine-tuning, and when each is appropriate. The last thing you should appreciate with these tools is that once you introduce them there is a trade-off here in our speed to iterate:

For RAG you need to tune the retrieval as well as LLM behavior
With fine-tuning you need to rerun the fine-tuning process and manage your training and validation sets when you do additional tuning.
Both of these can be time-consuming and complex processes, which can introduce regression issues as your LLM application becomes more complex. If you take away one thing from this paper, let it be to squeeze as much accuracy out of basic methods as you can before reaching for more complex RAG or fine-tuning - let your accuracy target be the objective, not jumping for RAG + FT because they are perceived as the most sophisticated.

How much accuracy is “good enough” for production
Tuning for accuracy can be a never-ending battle with LLMs - they are unlikely to get to 99.999% accuracy using off-the-shelf methods. This section is all about deciding when is enough for accuracy - how do you get comfortable putting an LLM in production, and how do you manage the risk of the solution you put out there.

I find it helpful to think of this in both a business and technical context. I’m going to describe the high level approaches to managing both, and use a customer service help-desk use case to illustrate how we manage our risk in both cases.

Business
For the business it can be hard to trust LLMs after the comparative certainties of rules-based or traditional machine learning systems, or indeed humans! A system where failures are open-ended and unpredictable is a difficult circle to square.

An approach I’ve seen be successful here was for a customer service use case - for this, we did the following:

First we identify the primary success and failure cases, and assign an estimated cost to them. This gives us a clear articulation of what the solution is likely to save or cost based on pilot performance.

For example, a case getting solved by an AI where it was previously solved by a human may save $20.
Someone getting escalated to a human when they shouldn’t might cost $40
In the worst case scenario, a customer gets so frustrated with the AI they churn, costing us $1000. We assume this happens in 5% of cases.
Event	Value	Number of cases	Total value
AI success	+20	815	$16,300
AI failure (escalation)	-40	175.75	$7,030
AI failure (churn)	-1000	9.25	$9,250
Result			+20
Break-even accuracy			81.5%
The other thing we did is to measure the empirical stats around the process which will help us measure the macro impact of the solution. Again using customer service, these could be:

The CSAT score for purely human interactions vs. AI ones
The decision accuracy for retrospectively reviewed cases for human vs. AI
The time to resolution for human vs. AI
In the customer service example, this helped us make two key decisions following a few pilots to get clear data:

Even if our LLM solution escalated to humans more than we wanted, it still made an enormous operational cost saving over the existing solution. This meant that an accuracy of even 85% could be ok, if those 15% were primarily early escalations.
Where the cost of failure was very high, such as a fraud case being incorrectly resolved, we decided the human would drive and the AI would function as an assistant. In this case, the decision accuracy stat helped us make the call that we weren’t comfortable with full autonomy.
Technical
On the technical side it is more clear - now that the business is clear on the value they expect and the cost of what can go wrong, your role is to build a solution that handles failures gracefully in a way that doesn’t disrupt the user experience.

Let’s use the customer service example one more time to illustrate this, and we’ll assume we’ve got a model that is 85% accurate in determining intent. As a technical team, here are a few ways we can minimize the impact of the incorrect 15%:

We can prompt engineer the model to prompt the customer for more information if it isn’t confident, so our first-time accuracy may drop but we may be more accurate given 2 shots to determine intent.
We can give the second-line assistant the option to pass back to the intent determination stage, again giving the UX a way of self-healing at the cost of some additional user latency.
We can prompt engineer the model to hand off to a human if the intent is unclear, which costs us some operational savings in the short-term but may offset customer churn risk in the long term.
Those decisions then feed into our UX, which gets slower at the cost of higher accuracy, or more human interventions, which feed into the cost model covered in the business section above.

You now have an approach to breaking down the business and technical decisions involved in setting an accuracy target that is grounded in business reality.

Taking this forward
This is a high level mental model for thinking about maximizing accuracy for LLMs, the tools you can use to achieve it, and the approach for deciding where enough is enough for production. You have the framework and tools you need to get to production consistently, and if you want to be inspired by what others have achieved with these methods then look no further than our customer stories, where use cases like Morgan Stanley and Klarna show what you can achieve by leveraging these techniques.
  Optimizing LLMs for accuracy
How to maximize correctness and consistent behavior when working with LLMs
Optimizing LLMs is hard.

We've worked with many developers across both start-ups and enterprises, and the reason optimization is hard consistently boils down to these reasons:

Knowing how to start optimizing accuracy
When to use what optimization method
What level of accuracy is good enough for production
This paper gives a mental model for how to optimize LLMs for accuracy and behavior. We’ll explore methods like prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning. We’ll also highlight how and when to use each technique, and share a few pitfalls.

As you read through, it's important to mentally relate these principles to what accuracy means for your specific use case. This may seem obvious, but there is a difference between producing a bad copy that a human needs to fix vs. refunding a customer $1000 rather than $100. You should enter any discussion on LLM accuracy with a rough picture of how much a failure by the LLM costs you, and how much a success saves or earns you - this will be revisited at the end, where we cover how much accuracy is “good enough” for production.

LLM optimization context
Many “how-to” guides on optimization paint it as a simple linear flow - you start with prompt engineering, then you move on to retrieval-augmented generation, then fine-tuning. However, this is often not the case - these are all levers that solve different things, and to optimize in the right direction you need to pull the right lever.

It is useful to frame LLM optimization as more of a matrix:

Accuracy mental model diagram

The typical LLM task will start in the bottom left corner with prompt engineering, where we test, learn, and evaluate to get a baseline. Once we’ve reviewed those baseline examples and assessed why they are incorrect, we can pull one of our levers:

Context optimization: You need to optimize for context when 1) the model lacks contextual knowledge because it wasn’t in its training set, 2) its knowledge is out of date, or 3) it requires knowledge of proprietary information. This axis maximizes response accuracy.
LLM optimization: You need to optimize the LLM when 1) the model is producing inconsistent results with incorrect formatting, 2) the tone or style of speech is not correct, or 3) the reasoning is not being followed consistently. This axis maximizes consistency of behavior.
In reality this turns into a series of optimization steps, where we evaluate, make a hypothesis on how to optimize, apply it, evaluate, and re-assess for the next step. Here’s an example of a fairly typical optimization flow:

Accuracy mental model journey diagram

In this example, we do the following:

Begin with a prompt, then evaluate its performance
Add static few-shot examples, which should improve consistency of results
Add a retrieval step so the few-shot examples are brought in dynamically based on the question - this boosts performance by ensuring relevant context for each input
Prepare a dataset of 50+ examples and fine-tune a model to increase consistency
Tune the retrieval and add a fact-checking step to find hallucinations to achieve higher accuracy
Re-train the fine-tuned model on the new training examples which include our enhanced RAG inputs
This is a fairly typical optimization pipeline for a tough business problem - it helps us decide whether we need more relevant context or if we need more consistent behavior from the model. Once we make that decision, we know which lever to pull as our first step toward optimization.

Now that we have a mental model, let’s dive into the methods for taking action on all of these areas. We’ll start in the bottom-left corner with Prompt Engineering.

Prompt engineering
Prompt engineering is typically the best place to start**. It is often the only method needed for use cases like summarization, translation, and code generation where a zero-shot approach can reach production levels of accuracy and consistency.

This is because it forces you to define what accuracy means for your use case - you start at the most basic level by providing an input, so you need to be able to judge whether or not the output matches your expectations. If it is not what you want, then the reasons why will show you what to use to drive further optimizations.

To achieve this, you should always start with a simple prompt and an expected output in mind, and then optimize the prompt by adding context, instructions, or examples until it gives you what you want.

Optimization
To optimize your prompts, I’ll mostly lean on strategies from the Prompt Engineering guide in the OpenAI API documentation. Each strategy helps you tune Context, the LLM, or both:

Strategy	Context optimization	LLM optimization
Write clear instructions		X
Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks	X	X
Give GPTs time to "think"		X
Test changes systematically	X	X
Provide reference text	X	
Use external tools	X	
These can be a little difficult to visualize, so we’ll run through an example where we test these out with a practical example. Let’s use gpt-4-turbo to correct Icelandic sentences to see how this can work.

Prompt engineering for language corrections
We’ve seen that prompt engineering is a great place to start, and that with the right tuning methods we can push the performance pretty far.

However, the biggest issue with prompt engineering is that it often doesn’t scale - we either need dynamic context to be fed to allow the model to deal with a wider range of problems than we can deal with through simple context stuffing or we need more consistent behavior than we can achieve with few-shot examples.

Deep dive
Using long context to scale prompt engineering
So how far can you really take prompt engineering? The answer is that it depends, and the way you make your decision is through evaluations.

Evaluation
This is why a good prompt with an evaluation set of questions and ground truth answers is the best output from this stage. If we have a set of 20+ questions and answers, and we have looked into the details of the failures and have a hypothesis of why they’re occurring, then we’ve got the right baseline to take on more advanced optimization methods.

Before you move on to more sophisticated optimization methods, it's also worth considering how to automate this evaluation to speed up your iterations. Some common practices we’ve seen be effective here are:

Using approaches like ROUGE or BERTScore to provide a finger-in-the-air judgment. This doesn’t correlate that closely with human reviewers, but can give a quick and effective measure of how much an iteration changed your model outputs.
Using GPT-4 as an evaluator as outlined in the G-Eval paper, where you provide the LLM a scorecard to assess the output as objectively as possible.
If you want to dive deeper on these, check out this cookbook which takes you through all of them in practice.

Understanding the tools
So you’ve done prompt engineering, you’ve got an eval set, and your model is still not doing what you need it to do. The most important next step is to diagnose where it is failing, and what tool works best to improve it.

Here is a basic framework for doing so:

The curling competitions of the 2022 Winter Olympics were held at the Beijing National Aquatics Centre, one of the Olympic Green venues. Curling competitions were scheduled for every day of the games, from February 2 to February 20.[1] This was the eighth time that curling was part of the Olympic program.

In each of the men's, women's, and mixed doubles competitions, 10 nations competed. The mixed doubles competition was expanded for its second appearance in the Olympics.[2] A total of 120 quota spots (60 per sex) were distributed to the sport of curling, an increase of four from the 2018 Winter Olympics.[3] A total of 3 events were contested, one for men, one for women, and one mixed.[4]

Qualification
Main article: Curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics – Qualification
Qualification to the Men's and Women's curling tournaments at the Winter Olympics was determined through two methods (in addition to the host nation). Nations qualified teams by placing in the top six at the 2021 World Curling Championships. Teams could also qualify through Olympic qualification events which were held in 2021. Six nations qualified via World Championship qualification placement, while three nations qualified through qualification events. In men's and women's play, a host will be selected for the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE). They would be joined by the teams which competed at the 2021 World Championships but did not qualify for the Olympics, and two qualifiers from the Pre-Olympic Qualification Event (Pre-OQE). The Pre-OQE was open to all member associations.[5]

For the mixed doubles competition in 2022, the tournament field was expanded from eight competitor nations to ten.[2] The top seven ranked teams at the 2021 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship qualified, along with two teams from the Olympic Qualification Event (OQE) – Mixed Doubles. This OQE was open to a nominated host and the fifteen nations with the highest qualification points not already qualified to the Olympics. As the host nation, China qualified teams automatically, thus making a total of ten teams per event in the curling tournaments.[6]

2. An example chat completion API call
A chat completion API call parameters, Required

model: the name of the model you want to use (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-1106)
messages: a list of message objects, where each object has two required fields:
role: the role of the messenger (either system, user, assistant or tool)
content: the content of the message (e.g., Write me a beautiful poem)
Messages can also contain an optional name field, which give the messenger a name. E.g., example-user, Alice, BlackbeardBot. Names may not contain spaces.

Optional

frequency_penalty: Penalizes tokens based on their frequency, reducing repetition.
logit_bias: Modifies likelihood of specified tokens with bias values.
logprobs: Returns log probabilities of output tokens if true.
top_logprobs: Specifies the number of most likely tokens to return at each position.
max_tokens: Sets the maximum number of generated tokens in chat completion.
n: Generates a specified number of chat completion choices for each input.
presence_penalty: Penalizes new tokens based on their presence in the text.
response_format: Specifies the output format, e.g., JSON mode.
seed: Ensures deterministic sampling with a specified seed.
stop: Specifies up to 4 sequences where the API should stop generating tokens.
stream: Sends partial message deltas as tokens become available.
temperature: Sets the sampling temperature between 0 and 2.
top_p: Uses nucleus sampling; considers tokens with top_p probability mass.
tools: Lists functions the model may call.
tool_choice: Controls the model's function calls (none/auto/function).
user: Unique identifier for end-user monitoring and abuse detection.
As of January 2024, you can also optionally submit a list of functions that tell GPT whether it can generate JSON to feed into a function. For details, see the documentation, API reference, or the Cookbook guide How to call functions with chat models.

Typically, a conversation will start with a system message that tells the assistant how to behave, followed by alternating user and assistant messages, but you are not required to follow this format.

Let's look at an example chat API calls to see how the chat format works in practice.
# Example OpenAI Python library request
MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Knock knock."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Who's there?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Orange."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)
print(json.dumps(json.loads(response.model_dump_json()), indent=4))
As you can see, the response object has a few fields:

id: the ID of the request
choices: a list of completion objects (only one, unless you set n greater than 1)
finish_reason: the reason the model stopped generating text (either stop, or length if max_tokens limit was reached)
index: The index of the choice in the list of choices.
logprobs: Log probability information for the choice.
message: the message object generated by the model
content: content of message
role: The role of the author of this message.
tool_calls: The tool calls generated by the model, such as function calls. if the tools is given
created: the timestamp of the request
model: the full name of the model used to generate the response
object: the type of object returned (e.g., chat.completion)
system_fingerprint: This fingerprint represents the backend configuration that the model runs with.
usage: the number of tokens used to generate the replies, counting prompt, completion, and total
Extract just the reply with:

response.choices[0].message.content

'Orange who?'
Even non-conversation-based tasks can fit into the chat format, by placing the instruction in the first user message.

For example, to ask the model to explain asynchronous programming in the style of the pirate Blackbeard, we can structure conversation as follows:

# example with a system message
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain asynchronous programming in the style of the pirate Blackbeard."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

Arr, me matey! Let me tell ye a tale of asynchronous programming, in the style of the fearsome pirate Blackbeard!

Picture this, me hearties. In the vast ocean of programming, there be times when ye need to perform multiple tasks at once. But fear not, for asynchronous programming be here to save the day!

Ye see, in traditional programming, ye be waitin' for one task to be done before movin' on to the next. But with asynchronous programming, ye can be takin' care of multiple tasks at the same time, just like a pirate multitaskin' on the high seas!

Instead of waitin' for a task to be completed, ye can be sendin' it off on its own journey, while ye move on to the next task. It be like havin' a crew of trusty sailors, each takin' care of their own duties, without waitin' for the others.

Now, ye may be wonderin', how does this sorcery work? Well, me matey, it be all about callbacks and promises. When ye be sendin' off a task, ye be attachin' a callback function to it. This be like leavin' a message in a bottle, tellin' the task what to do when it be finished.

While the task be sailin' on its own, ye can be movin' on to the next task, without wastin' any precious time. And when the first task be done, it be sendin' a signal back to ye, lettin' ye know it be finished. Then ye can be takin' care of the callback function, like openin' the bottle and readin' the message inside.

But wait, there be more! With promises, ye can be makin' even fancier arrangements. Instead of callbacks, ye be makin' a promise that the task will be completed. It be like a contract between ye and the task, swearin' that it will be done.

Ye can be attachin' multiple promises to a task, promisin' different outcomes. And when the task be finished, it be fulfillin' the promises, lettin' ye know it be done. Then ye can be handlin' the fulfillments, like collectin' the rewards of yer pirate adventures!

So, me hearties, that be the tale of asynchronous programming, told in the style of the fearsome pirate Blackbeard! With callbacks and promises, ye can be takin' care of multiple tasks at once, just like a pirate conquerin' the seven seas!
# example without a system message
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain asynchronous programming in the style of the pirate Blackbeard."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

Arr, me hearties! Gather 'round and listen up, for I be tellin' ye about the mysterious art of asynchronous programming, in the style of the fearsome pirate Blackbeard!

Now, ye see, in the world of programming, there be times when we need to perform tasks that take a mighty long time to complete. These tasks might involve fetchin' data from the depths of the internet, or performin' complex calculations that would make even Davy Jones scratch his head.

In the olden days, we pirates used to wait patiently for each task to finish afore movin' on to the next one. But that be a waste of precious time, me hearties! We be pirates, always lookin' for ways to be more efficient and plunder more booty!

That be where asynchronous programming comes in, me mateys. It be a way to tackle multiple tasks at once, without waitin' for each one to finish afore movin' on. It be like havin' a crew of scallywags workin' on different tasks simultaneously, while ye be overseein' the whole operation.

Ye see, in asynchronous programming, we be breakin' down our tasks into smaller chunks called "coroutines." Each coroutine be like a separate pirate, workin' on its own task. When a coroutine be startin' its work, it don't wait for the task to finish afore movin' on to the next one. Instead, it be movin' on to the next task, lettin' the first one continue in the background.

Now, ye might be wonderin', "But Blackbeard, how be we know when a task be finished if we don't wait for it?" Ah, me hearties, that be where the magic of callbacks and promises come in!

When a coroutine be startin' its work, it be attachin' a callback or a promise to it. This be like leavin' a message in a bottle, tellin' the coroutine what to do when it be finished. So, while the coroutine be workin' away, the rest of the crew be movin' on to other tasks, plunderin' more booty along the way.

When a coroutine be finished with its task, it be sendin' a signal to the callback or fulfillin' the promise, lettin' the rest of the crew know that it be done. Then, the crew can gather 'round and handle the results of the completed task, celebratin' their victory and countin' their plunder.

So, me hearties, asynchronous programming be like havin' a crew of pirates workin' on different tasks at once, without waitin' for each one to finish afore movin' on. It be a way to be more efficient, plunder more booty, and conquer the vast seas of programming!

Now, set sail, me mateys, and embrace the power of asynchronous programming like true pirates of the digital realm! Arr!
3. Tips for instructing gpt-3.5-turbo-0301
Best practices for instructing models may change from model version to model version. The advice that follows applies to gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 and may not apply to future models.

System messages
The system message can be used to prime the assistant with different personalities or behaviors.

Be aware that gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 does not generally pay as much attention to the system message as gpt-4-0314 or gpt-3.5-turbo-0613. Therefore, for gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, we recommend placing important instructions in the user message instead. Some developers have found success in continually moving the system message near the end of the conversation to keep the model's attention from drifting away as conversations get longer.

# An example of a system message that primes the assistant to explain concepts in great depth
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a friendly and helpful teaching assistant. You explain concepts in great depth using simple terms, and you give examples to help people learn. At the end of each explanation, you ask a question to check for understanding"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain how fractions work?"},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

Of course! Fractions are a way to represent parts of a whole. They are made up of two numbers: a numerator and a denominator. The numerator tells you how many parts you have, and the denominator tells you how many equal parts make up the whole.

Let's take an example to understand this better. Imagine you have a pizza that is divided into 8 equal slices. If you eat 3 slices, you can represent that as the fraction 3/8. Here, the numerator is 3 because you ate 3 slices, and the denominator is 8 because the whole pizza is divided into 8 slices.

Fractions can also be used to represent numbers less than 1. For example, if you eat half of a pizza, you can write it as 1/2. Here, the numerator is 1 because you ate one slice, and the denominator is 2 because the whole pizza is divided into 2 equal parts.

Now, let's talk about equivalent fractions. Equivalent fractions are different fractions that represent the same amount. For example, 1/2 and 2/4 are equivalent fractions because they both represent half of something. To find equivalent fractions, you can multiply or divide both the numerator and denominator by the same number.

Here's a question to check your understanding: If you have a cake divided into 12 equal slices and you eat 4 slices, what fraction of the cake did you eat?
# An example of a system message that primes the assistant to give brief, to-the-point answers
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a laconic assistant. You reply with brief, to-the-point answers with no elaboration."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain how fractions work?"},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

Fractions represent parts of a whole. They have a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).
Few-shot prompting
In some cases, it's easier to show the model what you want rather than tell the model what you want.

One way to show the model what you want is with faked example messages.

For example:

# An example of a faked few-shot conversation to prime the model into translating business jargon to simpler speech
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful, pattern-following assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Help me translate the following corporate jargon into plain English."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to!"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "New synergies will help drive top-line growth."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Things working well together will increase revenue."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Let's circle back when we have more bandwidth to touch base on opportunities for increased leverage."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's talk later when we're less busy about how to do better."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "This late pivot means we don't have time to boil the ocean for the client deliverable."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

This sudden change in direction means we don't have enough time to complete the entire project for the client.
To help clarify that the example messages are not part of a real conversation, and shouldn't be referred back to by the model, you can try setting the name field of system messages to example_user and example_assistant.

Transforming the few-shot example above, we could write:

# The business jargon translation example, but with example names for the example messages
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful, pattern-following assistant that translates corporate jargon into plain English."},
        {"role": "system", "name":"example_user", "content": "New synergies will help drive top-line growth."},
        {"role": "system", "name": "example_assistant", "content": "Things working well together will increase revenue."},
        {"role": "system", "name":"example_user", "content": "Let's circle back when we have more bandwidth to touch base on opportunities for increased leverage."},
        {"role": "system", "name": "example_assistant", "content": "Let's talk later when we're less busy about how to do better."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "This late pivot means we don't have time to boil the ocean for the client deliverable."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

This sudden change in direction means we don't have enough time to complete the entire project for the client.
Not every attempt at engineering conversations will succeed at first.

If your first attempts fail, don't be afraid to experiment with different ways of priming or conditioning the model.

As an example, one developer discovered an increase in accuracy when they inserted a user message that said "Great job so far, these have been perfect" to help condition the model into providing higher quality responses.

For more ideas on how to lift the reliability of the models, consider reading our guide on techniques to increase reliability. It was written for non-chat models, but many of its principles still apply.

4. Counting tokens
When you submit your request, the API transforms the messages into a sequence of tokens.

The number of tokens used affects:

the cost of the request
the time it takes to generate the response
when the reply gets cut off from hitting the maximum token limit (4,096 for gpt-3.5-turbo or 8,192 for gpt-4)
You can use the following function to count the number of tokens that a list of messages will use.

Note that the exact way that tokens are counted from messages may change from model to model. Consider the counts from the function below an estimate, not a timeless guarantee.

In particular, requests that use the optional functions input will consume extra tokens on top of the estimates calculated below.

Read more about counting tokens in How to count tokens with tiktoken.

import tiktoken


def num_tokens_from_messages(messages, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"):
    """Return the number of tokens used by a list of messages."""
    try:
        encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)
    except KeyError:
        print("Warning: model not found. Using cl100k_base encoding.")
        encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
    if model in {

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(

        )
    num_tokens = 0
    for message in messages:

import OpenAI from "openai";
 
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,
});
["async function getLocation() {
  const response = await fetch("https://ipapi.co/json/");
  const locationData = await response.json();
  return locationData;
}
async function getLocation() {
  const response = await fetch("https://ipapi.co/json/");
  const locationData = await response.json();
  return locationData;
}
Next, we'll create the two functions. The first one - getLocation - uses the IP API to get the location of the user.

async function getLocation() {
  const response = await fetch("https://ipapi.co/json/");
  const locationData = await response.json();
  return locationData;
}

The IP API returns a bunch of data about your location, including your latitude and longitude, which we’ll use as arguments in the second function getCurrentWeather. It uses the Open Meteo API to get the current weather data, like this:

async function getCurrentWeather(latitude, longitude) {
  const url = `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${latitude}&longitude=${longitude}&hourly=apparent_temperature`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const weatherData = await response.json();
  return weatherData;
}

Describing our functions for OpenAI
For OpenAI to understand the purpose of these functions, we need to describe them using a specific schema. We'll create an array called tools that contains one object per function. Each object will have two keys: type, function, and the function key has three subkeys: name, description, and parameters.

const tools = [
  {
    type: "function",
    function: {
      name: "getCurrentWeather",
      description: "Get the current weather in a given location",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          latitude: {
            type: "string",
          },
          longitude: {
            type: "string",
          },
        },
        required: ["longitude", "latitude"],
      },
    }
  },
  {
    type: "function",
    function: {
      name: "getLocation",
      description: "Get the user's location based on their IP address",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {},
      },
    }
  },
];

Setting up the messages array
We also need to define a messages array. This will keep track of all of the messages back and forth between our app and OpenAI.

The first object in the array should always have the role property set to "system", which tells OpenAI that this is how we want it to behave.

const messages = [
  {
    role: "system",
    content:
      "You are a helpful assistant. Only use the functions you have been provided with.",
  },
];

Creating the agent function
We are now ready to build the logic of our app, which lives in the agent function. It is asynchronous and takes one argument: the userInput.

We start by pushing the userInput to the messages array. This time, we set the role to "user", so that OpenAI knows that this is the input from the user.

async function agent(userInput) {
  messages.push({
    role: "user",
    content: userInput,
  });
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: messages,
    tools: tools,
  });
  console.log(response);
}

Next, we'll send a request to the Chat completions endpoint via the chat.completions.create() method in the Node SDK. This method takes a configuration object as an argument. In it, we'll specify three properties:

model - Decides which AI model we want to use (in our case, GPT-4).
messages - The entire history of messages between the user and the AI up until this point.
tools - A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool., we'll we use the tools array we created earlier.
Running our app with a simple input
Let's try to run the agent with an input that requires a function call to give a suitable reply.

agent("Where am I located right now?");

When we run the code above, we see the response from OpenAI logged out to the console like this:

{
    id: "chatcmpl-84ojoEJtyGnR6jRHK2Dl4zTtwsa7O",
    object: "chat.completion",
    created: 1696159040,
    model: "gpt-4-0613",
    choices: [{
        index: 0,
        message: {
            role: "assistant",
            content: null,
            tool_calls: [
              id: "call_CBwbo9qoXUn1kTR5pPuv6vR1",
              type: "function",
              function: {
                name: "getLocation",
                arguments: "{}"
              }
            ]
        },
        logprobs: null,
        finish_reason: "tool_calls" // OpenAI wants us to call a function
    }],
    usage: {
        prompt_tokens: 134,
        completion_tokens: 6,
        total_tokens: 140
    }
     system_fingerprint: null
}

This response tells us that we should call one of our functions, as it contains the following key: finish_reason: "tool_calls".

The name of the function can be found in the response.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0].function.name key, which is set to "getLocation".

Turning the OpenAI response into a function call
Now that we have the name of the function as a string, we'll need to translate that into a function call. To help us with that, we'll gather both of our functions in an object called availableTools:

const availableTools = {
  getCurrentWeather,
  getLocation,
};

This is handy because we'll be able to access the getLocation function via bracket notation and the string we got back from OpenAI, like this: availableTools["getLocation"].

const { finish_reason, message } = response.choices[0];
 
if (finish_reason === "tool_calls" && message.tool_calls) {
  const functionName = message.tool_calls[0].function.name;
  const functionToCall = availableTools[functionName];
  const functionArgs = JSON.parse(message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments);
  const functionArgsArr = Object.values(functionArgs);
  const functionResponse = await functionToCall.apply(null, functionArgsArr);
  console.log(functionResponse);
}

We're also grabbing ahold of any arguments OpenAI wants us to pass into the function: message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments. However, we won't need any arguments for this first function call.

If we run the code again with the same input ("Where am I located right now?"), we'll see that functionResponse is an object filled with location about where the user is located right now. In my case, that is Oslo, Norway.

{ip: "193.212.60.170", network: "193.212.60.0/23", version: "IPv4", city: "Oslo", region: "Oslo County", region_code: "03", country: "NO", country_name: "Norway", country_code: "NO", country_code_iso3: "NOR", country_capital: "Oslo", country_tld: ".no", continent_code: "EU", in_eu: false, postal: "0026", latitude: 59.955, longitude: 10.859, timezone: "Europe/Oslo", utc_offset: "+0200", country_calling_code: "+47", currency: "NOK", currency_name: "Krone", languages: "no,nb,nn,se,fi", country_area: 324220, country_population: 5314336, asn: "AS2119", org: "Telenor Norge AS"}

We'll add this data to a new item in the messages array, where we also specify the name of the function we called.

messages.push({
  role: "function",
  name: functionName,
  content: `The result of the last function was this: ${JSON.stringify(
    functionResponse
  )}
  `,
});

Notice that the role is set to "function". This tells OpenAI that the content parameter contains the result of the function call and not the input from the user.

At this point, we need to send a new request to OpenAI with this updated messages array. However, we don’t want to hard code a new function call, as our agent might need to go back and forth between itself and GPT several times until it has found the final answer for the user.

This can be solved in several different ways, e.g. recursion, a while-loop, or a for-loop. We'll use a good old for-loop for the sake of simplicity.

Creating the loop
At the top of the agent function, we'll create a loop that lets us run the entire procedure up to five times.

If we get back finish_reason: "tool_calls" from GPT, we'll just push the result of the function call to the messages array and jump to the next iteration of the loop, triggering a new request.

If we get finish_reason: "stop" back, then GPT has found a suitable answer, so we'll return the function and cancel the loop.

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: messages,
    tools: tools,
  });
  const { finish_reason, message } = response.choices[0];
 
  if (finish_reason === "tool_calls" && message.tool_calls) {
    const functionName = message.tool_calls[0].function.name;
    const functionToCall = availableTools[functionName];
    const functionArgs = JSON.parse(message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments);
    const functionArgsArr = Object.values(functionArgs);
    const functionResponse = await functionToCall.apply(null, functionArgsArr);
 
    messages.push({
      role: "function",
      name: functionName,
      content: `
          The result of the last function was this: ${JSON.stringify(
            functionResponse
          )}
          `,
    });
  } else if (finish_reason === "stop") {
    messages.push(message);
    return message.content;
  }
}
return "The maximum number of iterations has been met without a suitable answer. Please try again with a more specific input.";

If we don't see a finish_reason: "stop" within our five iterations, we'll return a message saying we couldn’t find a suitable answer.

Running the final app
At this point, we are ready to try our app! I'll ask the agent to suggest some activities based on my location and the current weather.

const response = await agent(
  "Please suggest some activities based on my location and the current weather."
);
console.log(response);

Here's what we see in the console (formatted to make it easier to read):

Based on your current location in Oslo, Norway and the weather (15°C and snowy),
here are some activity suggestions:
 
1. A visit to the Oslo Winter Park for skiing or snowboarding.
2. Enjoy a cosy day at a local café or restaurant.
3. Visit one of Oslo's many museums. The Fram Museum or Viking Ship Museum offer interesting insights into Norway’s seafaring history.
4. Take a stroll in the snowy streets and enjoy the beautiful winter landscape.
5. Enjoy a nice book by the fireplace in a local library.
6. Take a fjord sightseeing cruise to enjoy the snowy landscapes.
 
Always remember to bundle up and stay warm. Enjoy your day!

If we peak under the hood, and log out response.choices[0].message in each iteration of the loop, we'll see that GPT has instructed us to use both our functions before coming up with an answer.

First, it tells us to call the getLocation function. Then it tells us to call the getCurrentWeather function with "longitude": "10.859", "latitude": "59.955" passed in as the arguments. This is data it got back from the first function call we did.

{"role":"assistant","content":null,"tool_calls":[{"id":"call_Cn1KH8mtHQ2AMbyNwNJTweEP","type":"function","function":{"name":"getLocation","arguments":"{}"}}]}
{"role":"assistant","content":null,"tool_calls":[{"id":"call_uc1oozJfGTvYEfIzzcsfXfOl","type":"function","function":{"name":"getCurrentWeather","arguments":"{\n\"latitude\": \"10.859\",\n\"longitude\": \"59.955\"\n}
The example uses PCA to reduce the dimensionality fo the embeddings from 1536 to 3. Then we can visualize the data points in a 3D plot. The small dataset dbpedia_samples.jsonl is curated by randomly sampling 200 samples from DBpedia validation dataset.

1. Load the dataset and query embeddings
import pandas as pd
samples = pd.read_json("data/dbpedia_samples.jsonl", lines=True)
categories = sorted(samples["category"].unique())
print("Categories of DBpedia samples:", samples["category"].value_counts())
samples.head()

from utils.embeddings_utils import get_embeddings
# NOTE: The following code will send a query of batch size 200 to /embeddings
matrix = get_embeddings(samples["text"].to_list(), model="text-embedding-3-small")

2. Reduce the embedding dimensionality
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=3)
vis_dims = pca.fit_transform(matrix)
samples["embed_vis"] = vis_dims.tolist()

3. Plot the embeddings of lower dimensionality
%matplotlib widget
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
ax = fig.add_subplot(projection='3d')
cmap = plt.get_cmap("tab20")

# Plot each sample category individually such that we can set label name.
for i, cat in enumerate(categories):

We will use t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings from 1536 to 2. Once the embeddings are reduced to two dimensions, we can plot them in a 2D scatter plot. The dataset is created in the Get_embeddings_from_dataset Notebook.

1. Reduce dimensionality
We reduce the dimensionality to 2 dimensions using t-SNE decomposition.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import numpy as np
from ast import literal_eval

# Load the embeddings
datafile_path = "data/fine_food_reviews_with_embeddings_1k.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(datafile_path)

# Convert to a list of lists of floats
matrix = np.array(df.embedding.apply(literal_eval).to_list())

# Create a t-SNE model and transform the data
tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=15, random_state=42, init='random', learning_rate=200)
vis_dims = tsne.fit_transform(matrix)
vis_dims.shape

(1000, 2)
2. Plotting the embeddings
We colour each review by its star rating, ranging from red to green.

We can observe a decent data separation even in the reduced 2 dimensions.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib
import numpy as np

colors = ["red", "darkorange", "gold", "turquoise", "darkgreen"]
x = [x for x,y in vis_dims]
y = [y for x,y in vis_dims]
color_indices = df.Score.values - 1

colormap = matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap(colors)
plt.scatter(x, y, c=color_indices, cmap=colormap, alpha=0.3)
for score in [0,1,2,3,4]:
    avg_x = np.array(x)[df.Score-1==score].mean()
    avg_y = np.array(y)[df.Score-1==score].mean()
    color = colors[score]
    plt.scatter(avg_x, avg_y, marker='x', color=color, s=100)

plt.title("Amazon ratings visualized in language using t-SNE")

Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Amazon ratings visualized in language using t-SNE')

 We calculate user and product embeddings based on the training set, and evaluate the results on the unseen test set. We will evaluate the results by plotting the user and product similarity versus the review score. The dataset is created in the Get_embeddings_from_dataset Notebook.

1. Calculate user and product embeddings
We calculate these embeddings simply by averaging all the reviews about the same product or written by the same user within the training set.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from ast import literal_eval

df = pd.read_csv('data/fine_food_reviews_with_embeddings_1k.csv', index_col=0)  # note that you will need to generate this file to run the code below
df.head(2)

df['babbage_similarity'] = df["embedding"].apply(literal_eval).apply(np.array)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df, df.Score, test_size = 0.2, random_state=42)

user_embeddings = X_train.groupby('UserId').babbage_similarity.apply(np.mean)
prod_embeddings = X_train.groupby('ProductId').babbage_similarity.apply(np.mean)
len(user_embeddings), len(prod_embeddings)

(577, 706)
We can see that most of the users and products appear within the 50k examples only once.

2. Evaluate the embeddings
To evaluate the recommendations, we look at the similarity of the user and product embeddings amongst the reviews in the unseen test set. We calculate the cosine distance between the user and product embeddings, which gives us a similarity score between 0 and 1. We then normalize the scores to be evenly split between 0 and 1, by calculating the percentile of the similarity score amongst all predicted scores.

from utils.embeddings_utils import cosine_similarity

# evaluate embeddings as recommendations on X_test
def evaluate_single_match(row):
    user_id = row.UserId
    product_id = row.ProductId
    try:
        user_embedding = user_embeddings[user_id]
        product_embedding = prod_embeddings[product_id]
        similarity = cosine_similarity(user_embedding, product_embedding)
        return similarity
    except Exception as e:
        return np.nan

X_test['cosine_similarity'] = X_test.apply(evaluate_single_match, axis=1)
X_test['percentile_cosine_similarity'] = X_test.cosine_similarity.rank(pct=True)

2.1 Visualize cosine similarity by review score
We group the cosine similarity scores by the review score, and plot the distribution of cosine similarity scores for each review score.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.api as sm


correlation = X_test[['percentile_cosine_similarity', 'Score']].corr().values[0,1]
print('Correlation between user & vector similarity percentile metric and review number of stars (score): %.2f%%' % (100*correlation))

# boxplot of cosine similarity for each score
X_test.boxplot(column='percentile_cosine_similarity', by='Score')
plt.title('')
plt.show()
plt.close()

Correlation between user & vector similarity percentile metric and review number of stars (score): 29.56%
image generated by notebook
We can observe a weak trend, showing that the higher the similarity score between the user and the product embedding, the higher the review score. Therefore, the user and product embeddings can weakly predict the review score - even before the user receives the product!

Because this signal works in a different way than the more commonly used collaborative filtering, it can act as an additional feature to slightly improve the performance on existing problems.

datafile_path = "data/fine_food_reviews_with_embeddings_1k.csv"

df = pd.read_csv(datafile_path)
df["embedding"] = df.embedding.apply(literal_eval).apply(np.array)

Here we compare the cosine similarity of the embeddings of the query and the documents, and show top_n best matches.

# search through the reviews for a specific product
def search_reviews(df, product_description, n=3, pprint=True):

    )
    df["similarity"] = df.embedding.apply(lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, product_embedding))

    results = (

results = search_reviews(df, "delicious beans", n=3)

Regression means predicting a number, rather than one of the categories. We will predict the score based on the embedding of the review's text. We split the dataset into a training and a testing set for all of the following tasks, so we can realistically evaluate performance on unseen data. The dataset is created in the Get_embeddings_from_dataset Notebook.

We're predicting the score of the review, which is a number between 1 and 5 (1-star being negative and 5-star positive).

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from ast import literal_eval

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error

datafile_path = "data/fine_food_reviews_with_embeddings_1k.csv"

df = pd.read_csv(datafile_path)
df["embedding"] = df.embedding.apply(literal_eval).apply(np.array)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(list(df.embedding.values), df.Score, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

rfr = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
rfr.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds = rfr.predict(X_test)

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, preds)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, preds)

print(f"text-embedding-3-small performance on 1k Amazon reviews: mse={mse:.2f}, mae={mae:.2f}")

text-embedding-3-small performance on 1k Amazon reviews: mse=0.65, mae=0.52
bmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, np.repeat(y_test.mean(), len(y_test)))
bmae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, np.repeat(y_test.mean(), len(y_test)))
print(
    f"Dummy mean prediction performance on Amazon reviews: mse={bmse:.2f}, mae={bmae:.2f}"
)

Dummy mean prediction performance on Amazon reviews: mse=1.73, mae=1.03
We can see that the embeddings are able to predict the scores with an average error of 0.53 per score prediction. This is roughly equivalent to predicting half of reviews perfectly, and half off by one star.
  Recommendations are widespread across the web.

'Bought that item? Try these similar items.'
'Enjoy that book? Try these similar titles.'
'Not the help page you were looking for? Try these similar pages.'
This notebook demonstrates how to use embeddings to find similar items to recommend. In particular, we use AG's corpus of news articles as our dataset.

Our model will answer the question: given an article, what other articles are most similar to it?

import pandas as pd
import pickle

from utils.embeddings_utils import (
    get_embedding,
    distances_from_embeddings,
    tsne_components_from_embeddings,
    chart_from_components,
    indices_of_nearest_neighbors_from_distances,
)

EMBEDDING_MODEL = "text-embedding-3-small"

2. Load data
Next, let's load the AG news data and see what it looks like.

# load data (full dataset available at http://groups.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html)
dataset_path = "data/AG_news_samples.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(dataset_path)

Let's take a look at those same examples, but not truncated by ellipses.

# print the title, description, and label of each example

3. Build cache to save embeddings
Before getting embeddings for these articles, let's set up a cache to save the embeddings we generate. In general, it's a good idea to save your embeddings so you can re-use them later. If you don't save them, you'll pay again each time you compute them again.

The cache is a dictionary that maps tuples of (text, model) to an embedding, which is a list of floats. The cache is saved as a Python pickle file.

# establish a cache of embeddings to avoid recomputing
# cache is a dict of tuples (text, model) -> embedding, saved as a pickle file

# set path to embedding cache
embedding_cache_path = "data/recommendations_embeddings_cache.pkl"

# load the cache if it exists, and save a copy to disk
try:
    embedding_cache = pd.read_pickle(embedding_cache_path)
except FileNotFoundError:
    embedding_cache = {}
with open(embedding_cache_path, "wb") as embedding_cache_file:
    pickle.dump(embedding_cache, embedding_cache_file)

# define a function to retrieve embeddings from the cache if present, and otherwise request via the API
def embedding_from_string(
    string: str,
    model: str = EMBEDDING_MODEL,
    embedding_cache=embedding_cache
) -> list:
    """Return embedding of given string, using a cache to avoid recomputing."""
    if (string, model) not in embedding_cache.keys():
        embedding_cache[(string, model)] = get_embedding(string, model)
        with open(embedding_cache_path, "wb") as embedding_cache_file:
            pickle.dump(embedding_cache, embedding_cache_file)
    return embedding_cache[(string, model)]

Let's check that it works by getting an embedding.

# as an example, take the first description from the dataset
example_string = df["description"].values[0]
print(f"\nExample string: {example_string}")

# print the first 10 dimensions of the embedding
example_embedding = embedding_from_string(example_string)
print(f"\nExample embedding: {example_embedding[:10]}...")


Example string: BRITAIN: BLAIR WARNS OF CLIMATE THREAT Prime Minister Tony Blair urged the international community to consider global warming a dire threat and agree on a plan of action to curb the  quot;alarming quot; growth of greenhouse gases.

Example embedding: [0.0545826330780983, -0.00428084097802639, 0.04785159230232239, 0.01587914116680622, -0.03640881925821304, 0.0143799539655447, -0.014267769642174244, -0.015175441280007362, -0.002344391541555524, 0.011075624264776707]...
4. Recommend similar articles based on embeddings
To find similar articles, let's follow a three-step plan:

Get the similarity embeddings of all the article descriptions
Calculate the distance between a source title and all other articles
Print out the other articles closest to the source title
def print_recommendations_from_strings(
    strings: list[str],
    index_of_source_string: int,
    k_nearest_neighbors: int = 1,
    model=EMBEDDING_MODEL,
) -> list[int]:
    """Print out the k nearest neighbors of a given string."""
    # get embeddings for all strings
    embeddings = [embedding_from_string(string, model=model) for string in strings]

    # get the embedding of the source string
    query_embedding = embeddings[index_of_source_string]

    # get distances between the source embedding and other embeddings (function from utils.embeddings_utils.py)
    distances = distances_from_embeddings(query_embedding, embeddings, distance_metric="cosine")
    
    # get indices of nearest neighbors (function from utils.utils.embeddings_utils.py)
    indices_of_nearest_neighbors = indices_of_nearest_neighbors_from_distances(distances)

    # print out source string
    query_string = strings[index_of_source_string]
    print(f"Source string: {query_string}")
    # print out its k nearest neighbors
    k_counter = 0
    for i in indices_of_nearest_neighbors:
        # skip any strings that are identical matches to the starting string
        if query_string == strings[i]:
            continue
        # stop after printing out k articles
        if k_counter >= k_nearest_neighbors:
            break
        k_counter += 1

        # print out the similar strings and their distances
        print(
            f"""
        --- Recommendation #{k_counter} (nearest neighbor {k_counter} of {k_nearest_neighbors}) ---
        String: {strings[i]}
        Distance: {distances[i]:0.3f}"""
        )

    return indices_of_nearest_neighbors

5. Example recommendations
Let's look for articles similar to first one, which was about Tony Blair.

article_descriptions = df["description"].tolist()

tony_blair_articles = print_recommendations_from_strings(
    strings=article_descriptions,  # let's base similarity off of the article description
    index_of_source_string=0,  # articles similar to the first one about Tony Blair
    k_nearest_neighbors=5,  # 5 most similar articles
)

Source string: BRITAIN: BLAIR WARNS OF CLIMATE THREAT Prime Minister Tony Blair urged the international community to consider global warming a dire threat and agree on a plan of action to curb the  quot;alarming quot; growth of greenhouse gases.

        --- Recommendation #1 (nearest neighbor 1 of 5) ---
        String: The anguish of hostage Kenneth Bigley in Iraq hangs over Prime Minister Tony Blair today as he faces the twin test of a local election and a debate by his Labour Party about the divisive war.
        Distance: 0.514

        --- Recommendation #2 (nearest neighbor 2 of 5) ---
        String: THE re-election of British Prime Minister Tony Blair would be seen as an endorsement of the military action in Iraq, Prime Minister John Howard said today.
        Distance: 0.516

        --- Recommendation #3 (nearest neighbor 3 of 5) ---
        String: Israel is prepared to back a Middle East conference convened by Tony Blair early next year despite having expressed fears that the British plans were over-ambitious and designed 
        Distance: 0.546

        --- Recommendation #4 (nearest neighbor 4 of 5) ---
        String: Allowing dozens of casinos to be built in the UK would bring investment and thousands of jobs, Tony Blair says.
        Distance: 0.568

        --- Recommendation #5 (nearest neighbor 5 of 5) ---
        String: AFP - A battle group of British troops rolled out of southern Iraq on a US-requested mission to deadlier areas near Baghdad, in a major political gamble for British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
        Distance: 0.579
Pretty good! 4 of the 5 recommendations explicitly mention Tony Blair and the fifth is an article from London about climate change, topics that might be often associated with Tony Blair.

Let's see how our recommender does on the second example article about NVIDIA's new chipset with more security.

chipset_security_articles = print_recommendations_from_strings(
    strings=article_descriptions,  # let's base similarity off of the article description
    index_of_source_string=1,  # let's look at articles similar to the second one about a more secure chipset
    k_nearest_neighbors=5,  # let's look at the 5 most similar articles
)

Source string: PC World - Upcoming chip set will include built-in security features for your PC.

        --- Recommendation #1 (nearest neighbor 1 of 5) ---
        String: PC World - Updated antivirus software for businesses adds intrusion prevention features.
        Distance: 0.422

        --- Recommendation #2 (nearest neighbor 2 of 5) ---
        String: PC World - Symantec, McAfee hope raising virus-definition fees will move users to\  suites.
        Distance: 0.518

        --- Recommendation #3 (nearest neighbor 3 of 5) ---
        String: originally offered on notebook PCs -- to its Opteron 32- and 64-bit x86 processors for server applications. The technology will help servers to run 
        Distance: 0.522

        --- Recommendation #4 (nearest neighbor 4 of 5) ---
        String: PC World - Send your video throughout your house--wirelessly--with new gateways and media adapters.
        Distance: 0.532

        --- Recommendation #5 (nearest neighbor 5 of 5) ---
        String: Chips that help a computer's main microprocessors perform specific types of math problems are becoming a big business once again.\
        Distance: 0.532
From the printed distances, you can see that the #1 recommendation is much closer than all the others (0.11 vs 0.14+). And the #1 recommendation looks very similar to the starting article - it's another article from PC World about increasing computer security. Pretty good!

Appendix: Using embeddings in more sophisticated recommenders
A more sophisticated way to build a recommender system is to train a machine learning model that takes in tens or hundreds of signals, such as item popularity or user click data. Even in this system, embeddings can be a very useful signal into the recommender, especially for items that are being 'cold started' with no user data yet (e.g., a brand new product added to the catalog without any clicks yet).

Appendix: Using embeddings to visualize similar articles
To get a sense of what our nearest neighbor recommender is doing, let's visualize the article embeddings. Although we can't plot the 2048 dimensions of each embedding vector, we can use techniques like t-SNE or PCA to compress the embeddings down into 2 or 3 dimensions, which we can chart.

Before visualizing the nearest neighbors, let's visualize all of the article descriptions using t-SNE. Note that t-SNE is not deterministic, meaning that results may vary from run to run.

# get embeddings for all article descriptions
embeddings = [embedding_from_string(string) for string in article_descriptions]
# compress the 2048-dimensional embeddings into 2 dimensions using t-SNE
tsne_components = tsne_components_from_embeddings(embeddings)
# get the article labels for coloring the chart
labels = df["label"].tolist()

chart_from_components(
    components=tsne_components,
    labels=labels,
    strings=article_descriptions,
    width=600,
    height=500,
    title="t-SNE components of article descriptions",
)

As you can see in the chart above, even the highly compressed embeddings do a good job of clustering article descriptions by category. And it's worth emphasizing: this clustering is done with no knowledge of the labels themselves!

Also, if you look closely at the most egregious outliers, they are often due to mislabeling rather than poor embedding. For example, the majority of the blue World points in the green Sports cluster appear to be Sports stories.

Next, let's recolor the points by whether they are a source article, its nearest neighbors, or other.

# create labels for the recommended articles
def nearest_neighbor_labels(
    list_of_indices: list[int],
    k_nearest_neighbors: int = 5
) -> list[str]:
    """Return a list of labels to color the k nearest neighbors."""
    labels = ["Other" for _ in list_of_indices]
    source_index = list_of_indices[0]
    labels[source_index] = "Source"
    for i in range(k_nearest_neighbors):
        nearest_neighbor_index = list_of_indices[i + 1]
        labels[nearest_neighbor_index] = f"Nearest neighbor (top {k_nearest_neighbors})"
    return labels


tony_blair_labels = nearest_neighbor_labels(tony_blair_articles, k_nearest_neighbors=5)
chipset_security_labels = nearest_neighbor_labels(chipset_security_articles, k_nearest_neighbors=5
)

# a 2D chart of nearest neighbors of the Tony Blair article
chart_from_components(
    components=tsne_components,
    labels=tony_blair_labels,
    strings=article_descriptions,
    width=600,
    height=500,
    title="Nearest neighbors of the Tony Blair article",
    category_orders={"label": ["Other", "Nearest neighbor (top 5)", "Source"]},
)

Looking at the 2D chart above, we can see that the articles about Tony Blair are somewhat close together inside of the World news cluster. Interestingly, although the 5 nearest neighbors (red) were closest in high dimensional space, they are not the closest points in this compressed 2D space. Compressing the embeddings down to 2 dimensions discards much of their information, and the nearest neighbors in the 2D space don't seem to be as relevant as those in the full embedding space.

# a 2D chart of nearest neighbors of the chipset security article
chart_from_components(
    components=tsne_components,
    labels=chipset_security_labels,
    strings=article_descriptions,
    width=600,
    height=500,
    title="Nearest neighbors of the chipset security article",
    category_orders={"label": ["Other", "Nearest neighbor (top 5)", "Source"]},
)

For the chipset security example, the 4 closest nearest neighbors in the full embedding space remain nearest neighbors in this compressed 2D visualization. The fifth is displayed as more distant, despite being closer in the full embedding space.

Should you want to, you can also make an interactive 3D plot of the embeddings with the function chart_from_components_3D. (Doing so will require recomputing the t-SNE components with n_components=3.)
We use a simple k-means algorithm to demonstrate how clustering can be done. Clustering can help discover valuable, hidden groupings within the data. The dataset is created in the Get_embeddings_from_dataset Notebook.

2. Text samples in the clusters & naming the clusters
Let's show random samples from each cluster. We'll use gpt-4 to name the clusters, based on a random sample of 5 reviews from that cluster.

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))

# Reading a review which belong to each group.

        .str.replace("\n\nContent: ", ":  ")

    )

    print(response.choices[0].message.content.replace("\n", ""))

    sample_cluster_rows = df[df.Cluster == i].sample(rev_per_cluster, random_state=42)
    for j in range(rev_per_cluster):

It's important to note that clusters will not necessarily match what you intend to use them for. A larger amount of clusters will focus on more specific patterns, whereas a small number of clusters will usually focus on largest discrepencies in the data.
For this notebook we will be looking to classify a public dataset of transactions into a number of categories that we have predefined. These approaches should be replicable to any multiclass classification use case where we are trying to fit transactional data into predefined categories, and by the end of running through this you should have a few approaches for dealing with both labelled and unlabelled datasets.

The different approaches we'll be taking in this notebook are:

Zero-shot Classification: First we'll do zero shot classification to put transactions in one of five named buckets using only a prompt for guidance
Classification with Embeddings: Following this we'll create embeddings on a labelled dataset, and then use a traditional classification model to test their effectiveness at identifying our categories
Fine-tuned Classification: Lastly we'll produce a fine-tuned model trained on our labelled dataset to see how this compares to the zero-shot and few-shot classification approaches

Zero-shot Classification
We'll first assess the performance of the base models at classifying these transactions using a simple prompt. We'll provide the model with 5 categories and a catch-all of "Could not classify" for ones that it cannot place.

zero_shot_prompt = '''You are a data expert working for the National Library of Scotland.
You are analysing all transactions over £25,000 in value and classifying them into one of five categories.
The five categories are Building Improvement, Literature & Archive, Utility Bills, Professional Services and Software/IT.
If you can't tell what it is, say Could not classify

Transaction:

Supplier: SUPPLIER_NAME
Description: DESCRIPTION_TEXT
Value: TRANSACTION_VALUE

The classification is:'''

# Get a test transaction
transaction = transactions.iloc[0]

# Interpolate the values into the prompt
prompt = zero_shot_prompt.replace('SUPPLIER_NAME',transaction['Supplier'])
prompt = prompt.replace('DESCRIPTION_TEXT',transaction['Description'])
prompt = prompt.replace('TRANSACTION_VALUE',str(transaction['Transaction value (£)']))

# Use our completion function to return a prediction
completion_response = request_completion(prompt)
print(completion_response.choices[0].text)

 Building Improvement
Our first attempt is correct, M & J Ballantyne Ltd are a house builder and the work they performed is indeed Building Improvement.

Lets expand the sample size to 25 and see how it performs, again with just a simple prompt to guide it

test_transactions = transactions.iloc[:25]
test_transactions['Classification'] = test_transactions.apply(lambda x: classify_transaction(x,zero_shot_prompt),axis=1)

Initial results are pretty good even with no labelled examples! The ones that it could not classify were tougher cases with few clues as to their topic, but maybe if we clean up the labelled dataset to give more examples we can get better performance.

Classification with Embeddings
Lets create embeddings from the small set that we've classified so far - we've made a set of labelled examples by running the zero-shot classifier on 101 transactions from our dataset and manually correcting the 15 Could not classify results that we got

Create embeddings
This initial section reuses the approach from the Get_embeddings_from_dataset Notebook to create embeddings from a combined field concatenating all of our features

Performance for this model is pretty strong, so creating embeddings and using even a simpler classifier looks like an effective approach as well, with the zero-shot classifier helping us do the initial classification of the unlabelled dataset.

Lets take it one step further and see if a fine-tuned model trained on this same labelled datasets gives us comparable results

Fine-tuned Transaction Classification
For this use case we're going to try to improve on the few-shot classification from above by training a fine-tuned model on the same labelled set of 101 transactions and applying this fine-tuned model on group of unseen transactions

Building Fine-tuned Classifier
We'll need to do some data prep first to get our data ready. This will take the following steps:

First we'll list out our classes and replace them with numeric identifiers. Making the model predict a single token rather than multiple consecutive ones like 'Building Improvement' should give us better results
We also need to add a common prefix and suffix to each example to aid the model in making predictions - in our case our text is already started with 'Supplier' and we'll add a suffix of '\n\n###\n\n'
Lastly we'll aid a leading whitespace onto each of our target classes for classification, again to aid the model

Performance is not great - unfortunately this is expected. With only a few examples of each class, the above approach with embeddings and a traditional classifier worked better.

A fine-tuned model works best with a great number of labelled observations. If we had a few hundred or thousand we may get better results, but lets do one last test on a holdout set to confirm that it doesn't generalise well to a new set of observations

Well those results were similarly underwhelming - so we've learned that with a dataset with a small number of labelled observations, either zero-shot classification or traditional classification with embeddings return better results than a fine-tuned model.

A fine-tuned model is still a great tool, but is more effective when you have a larger number of labelled examples for each class that you're looking to classify
Complex tasks, such as writing unit tests, can benefit from multi-step prompts. In contrast to a single prompt, a multi-step prompt generates text from GPT and then feeds that output text back into subsequent prompts. This can help in cases where you want GPT to reason things out before answering, or brainstorm a plan before executing it.

In this notebook, we use a 3-step prompt to write unit tests in Python using the following steps:

Explain: Given a Python function, we ask GPT to explain what the function is doing and why.
Plan: We ask GPT to plan a set of unit tests for the function.
If the plan is too short, we ask GPT to elaborate with more ideas for unit tests.
Execute: Finally, we instruct GPT to write unit tests that cover the planned cases.
The code example illustrates a few embellishments on the chained, multi-step prompt:

Conditional branching (e.g., asking for elaboration only if the first plan is too short)
The choice of different models for different steps
A check that re-runs the function if the output is unsatisfactory (e.g., if the output code cannot be parsed by Python's ast module)
Streaming output so that you can start reading the output before it's fully generated (handy for long, multi-step outputs)
# imports needed to run the code in this notebook
import ast  # used for detecting whether generated Python code is valid

- Take advantage of the features of `pytest` to make the tests easy to write and maintain
- Be easy to read and understand, with clean code and descriptive names
- Be deterministic, so that the tests always pass or fail in the same way

How large language models work
Large language models are functions that map text to text. Given an input string of text, a large language model predicts the text that should come next.

The magic of large language models is that by being trained to minimize this prediction error over vast quantities of text, the models end up learning concepts useful for these predictions. For example, they learn:

how to spell
how grammar works
how to paraphrase
how to answer questions
how to hold a conversation
how to write in many languages
how to code
etc.
They do this by “reading” a large amount of existing text and learning how words tend to appear in context with other words, and uses what it has learned to predict the next most likely word that might appear in response to a user request, and each subsequent word after that.

GPT-3 and GPT-4 power many software products, including productivity apps, education apps, games, and more.

How to control a large language model
Of all the inputs to a large language model, by far the most influential is the text prompt.

Large language models can be prompted to produce output in a few ways:

Instruction: Tell the model what you want
Completion: Induce the model to complete the beginning of what you want
Scenario: Give the model a situation to play out
Demonstration: Show the model what you want, with either:
A few examples in the prompt
Many hundreds or thousands of examples in a fine-tuning training dataset
An example of each is shown below.

Instruction prompts
Write your instruction at the top of the prompt (or at the bottom, or both), and the model will do its best to follow the instruction and then stop. Instructions can be detailed, so don't be afraid to write a paragraph explicitly detailing the output you want, just stay aware of how many tokens the model can process.

Example instruction prompt:

Extract the name of the author from the quotation below.
“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they're correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”
― Ted Chiang, Exhalation

Output:

Ted Chiang

Completion prompt example
Completion-style prompts take advantage of how large language models try to write text they think is most likely to come next. To steer the model, try beginning a pattern or sentence that will be completed by the output you want to see. Relative to direct instructions, this mode of steering large language models can take more care and experimentation. In addition, the models won't necessarily know where to stop, so you will often need stop sequences or post-processing to cut off text generated beyond the desired output.

Example completion prompt:

“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they're correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”
― Ted Chiang, Exhalation
The author of this quote is

Output:

 Ted Chiang

Scenario prompt example
Giving the model a scenario to follow or role to play out can be helpful for complex queries or when seeking imaginative responses. When using a hypothetical prompt, you set up a situation, problem, or story, and then ask the model to respond as if it were a character in that scenario or an expert on the topic.

Example scenario prompt:

Your role is to extract the name of the author from any given text
“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they're correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”
― Ted Chiang, Exhalation

Output:

 Ted Chiang

Demonstration prompt example (few-shot learning)
Similar to completion-style prompts, demonstrations can show the model what you want it to do. This approach is sometimes called few-shot learning, as the model learns from a few examples provided in the prompt.

Example demonstration prompt:

Quote:
“When the reasoning mind is forced to confront the impossible again and again, it has no choice but to adapt.”
― N.K. Jemisin, The Fifth Season
Author: N.K. Jemisin
Quote:
“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they're correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”
― Ted Chiang, Exhalation
Author:

Output:

 Ted Chiang

Fine-tuned prompt example
With enough training examples, you can fine-tune a custom model. In this case, instructions become unnecessary, as the model can learn the task from the training data provided. However, it can be helpful to include separator sequences (e.g., -> or ### or any string that doesn't commonly appear in your inputs) to tell the model when the prompt has ended and the output should begin. Without separator sequences, there is a risk that the model continues elaborating on the input text rather than starting on the answer you want to see.

Example fine-tuned prompt (for a model that has been custom trained on similar prompt-completion pairs):

“Some humans theorize that intelligent species go extinct before they can expand into outer space. If they're correct, then the hush of the night sky is the silence of the graveyard.”
― Ted Chiang, Exhalation
###

Output:

 Ted Chiang

Code Capabilities
Large language models aren't only great at text - they can be great at code too. OpenAI's GPT-4 model is a prime example.

GPT-4 powers numerous innovative products, including:

GitHub Copilot (autocompletes code in Visual Studio and other IDEs)
Replit (can complete, explain, edit and generate code)
Cursor (build software faster in an editor designed for pair-programming with AI)
GPT-4 is more advanced than previous models like gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct. But, to get the best out of GPT-4 for coding tasks, it's still important to give clear and specific instructions. As a result, designing good prompts can take more care.

More prompt advice
For more prompt examples, visit OpenAI Examples.

In general, the input prompt is the best lever for improving model outputs. You can try tricks like:

Be more specific E.g., if you want the output to be a comma separated list, ask it to return a comma separated list. If you want it to say "I don't know" when it doesn't know the answer, tell it 'Say "I don't know" if you do not know the answer.' The more specific your instructions, the better the model can respond.
Provide Context: Help the model understand the bigger picture of your request. This could be background information, examples/demonstrations of what you want or explaining the purpose of your task.
Ask the model to answer as if it was an expert. Explicitly asking the model to produce high quality output or output as if it was written by an expert can induce the model to give higher quality answers that it thinks an expert would write. Phrases like "Explain in detail" or "Describe step-by-step" can be effective.
Prompt the model to write down the series of steps explaining its reasoning. If understanding the 'why' behind an answer is important, prompt the model to include its reasoning. This can be done by simply adding a line like "Let's think step by step" before each answer.
We will upload the data to Weights & Biases and use an Embedding Projector to visualize the embeddings using common dimension reduction algorithms like PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE. The dataset is created in the Get_embeddings_from_dataset Notebook.

What is Weights & Biases?
Weights & Biases is a machine learning platform used by OpenAI and other ML teams to build better models faster. They use it to quickly track experiments, evaluate model performance, reproduce models, visualize results, and share findings with colleagues.

1. Log the data to W&B
We create a W&B Table with the original data and the embeddings. Each review is a new row and the 1536 embedding floats are given their own column named emb_{i}.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import numpy as np
from ast import literal_eval

# Load the embeddings
datafile_path = "data/fine_food_reviews_with_embeddings_1k.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(datafile_path)

# Convert to a list of lists of floats
matrix = np.array(df.embedding.apply(literal_eval).to_list())

import wandb

original_cols = df.columns[1:-1].tolist()
embedding_cols = ['emb_'+str(idx) for idx in range(len(matrix[0]))]
table_cols = original_cols + embedding_cols

with wandb.init(project='openai_embeddings'):
    table = wandb.Table(columns=table_cols)
    for i, row in enumerate(df.to_dict(orient="records")):
        original_data = [row[col_name] for col_name in original_cols]
        embedding_data = matrix[i].tolist()
        table.add_data(*(original_data + embedding_data))
    wandb.log({'openai_embedding_table': table})

2. Render as 2D Projection
After navigating to the W&B run link, we click the ⚙️ icon in the top right of the Table and change "Render As:" to "Combined 2D Projection".

Example: http://wandb.me/openai_embeddings
his notebook is prepared for a scenario where:

Your data is not vectorized
You want to run Hybrid Search (learn more) on your data
You want to use Weaviate with the OpenAI module (text2vec-openai), to generate vector embeddings for you.
This notebook takes you through a simple flow to set up a Weaviate instance, connect to it (with OpenAI API key), configure data schema, import data (which will automatically generate vector embeddings for your data), and run hybrid search (mixing of vector and BM25 search).

This is a common requirement for customers who want to store and search our embeddings with their own data in a secure environment to support production use cases such as chatbots, topic modelling and more.

What is Weaviate
Weaviate is an open-source vector search engine that stores data objects together with their vectors. This allows for combining vector search with structured filtering.

Weaviate uses KNN algorithms to create an vector-optimized index, which allows your queries to run extremely fast. Learn more here.

Weaviate let you use your favorite ML-models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects.

Deployment options
Whatever your scenario or production setup, Weaviate has an option for you. You can deploy Weaviate in the following setups:

Self-hosted – you can deploy Weaviate with docker locally, or any server you want.
SaaS – you can use Weaviate Cloud Service (WCS) to host your Weaviate instances.
Hybrid-SaaS – you can deploy Weaviate in your own private Cloud Service
Programming languages
Weaviate offers four client libraries, which allow you to communicate from your apps:

Python
JavaScript
Java
Go
Additionally, Weaviate has a REST layer. Basically you can call Weaviate from any language that supports REST requests.

Demo Flow
The demo flow is:

Prerequisites Setup: Create a Weaviate instance and install required libraries
Connect: Connect to your Weaviate instance
Schema Configuration: Configure the schema of your data
Note: Here we can define which OpenAI Embedding Model to use
Note: Here we can configure which properties to index
Import data: Load a demo dataset and import it into Weaviate
Note: The import process will automatically index your data - based on the configuration in the schema
Note: You don't need to explicitly vectorize your data, Weaviate will communicate with OpenAI to do it for you
Run Queries: Query
Note: You don't need to explicitly vectorize your queries, Weaviate will communicate with OpenAI to do it for you
Once you've run through this notebook you should have a basic understanding of how to setup and use vector databases, and can move on to more complex use cases making use of our embeddings.

All Weaviate instances come equipped with the text2vec-openai module.

This module is responsible for handling vectorization during import (or any CRUD operations) and when you run a query.

No need to manually vectorize data
This is great news for you. With text2vec-openai you don't need to manually vectorize your data, as Weaviate will call OpenAI for you whenever necessary.

All you need to do is:

provide your OpenAI API Key – when you connected to the Weaviate Client
define which OpenAI vectorizer to use in your Schema
Prerequisites
Before we start this project, we need setup the following:

create a Weaviate instance
install libraries
weaviate-client
datasets
apache-beam
get your OpenAI API key
===========================================================

Create a Weaviate instance
To create a Weaviate instance we have 2 options:

(Recommended path) Weaviate Cloud Service – to host your Weaviate instance in the cloud. The free sandbox should be more than enough for this cookbook.
Install and run Weaviate locally with Docker.
Option 1 – WCS Installation Steps
Use Weaviate Cloud Service (WCS) to create a free Weaviate cluster.

create a free account and/or login to WCS
create a Weaviate Cluster with the following settings:
Sandbox: Sandbox Free
Weaviate Version: Use default (latest)
OIDC Authentication: Disabled
your instance should be ready in a minute or two
make a note of the Cluster Id. The link will take you to the full path of your cluster (you will need it later to connect to it). It should be something like: https://your-project-name.weaviate.network
Option 2 – local Weaviate instance with Docker
Install and run Weaviate locally with Docker.

Download the ./docker-compose.yml file
Then open your terminal, navigate to where your docker-compose.yml file is located, and start docker with: docker-compose up -d
Once this is ready, your instance should be available at http://localhost:8080
Note. To shut down your docker instance you can call: docker-compose down

Learn more
To learn more, about using Weaviate with Docker see the installation documentation.

===========================================================

Install required libraries
Before running this project make sure to have the following libraries:

Weaviate Python client
The Weaviate Python client allows you to communicate with your Weaviate instance from your Python project.

datasets & apache-beam
To load sample data, you need the datasets library and its' dependency apache-beam.

# Install the Weaviate client for Python
!pip install weaviate-client>3.11.0

# Install datasets and apache-beam to load the sample datasets
!pip install datasets apache-beam

===========================================================

Prepare your OpenAI API key
The OpenAI API key is used for vectorization of your data at import, and for running queries.

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.

Once you get your key, please add it to your environment variables as OPENAI_API_KEY.

# Export OpenAI API Key
!export OPENAI_API_KEY="your key"

# Test that your OpenAI API key is correctly set as an environment variable
# Note. if you run this notebook locally, you will need to reload your terminal and the notebook for the env variables to be live.
import os

# Note. alternatively you can set a temporary env variable like this:
# os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'your-key-goes-here'

if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") is not None:
    print ("OPENAI_API_KEY is ready")
else:
    print ("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found")

Connect to your Weaviate instance
In this section, we will:

test env variable OPENAI_API_KEY – make sure you completed the step in #Prepare-your-OpenAI-API-key
connect to your Weaviate your OpenAI API Key
and test the client connection
The client
After this step, the client object will be used to perform all Weaviate-related operations.

import weaviate
from datasets import load_dataset
import os

# Connect to your Weaviate instance
client = weaviate.Client(
    url="https://your-wcs-instance-name.weaviate.network/",
#   url="http://localhost:8080/",
    auth_client_secret=weaviate.auth.AuthApiKey(api_key="<YOUR-WEAVIATE-API-KEY>"), # comment out this line if you are not using authentication for your Weaviate instance (i.e. for locally deployed instances)
    additional_headers={
        "X-OpenAI-Api-Key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    }
)

# Check if your instance is live and ready
# This should return `True`
client.is_ready()

Schema
In this section, we will:

configure the data schema for your data
select OpenAI module
This is the second and final step, which requires OpenAI specific configuration. After this step, the rest of instructions wlll only touch on Weaviate, as the OpenAI tasks will be handled automatically.

What is a schema
In Weaviate you create schemas to capture each of the entities you will be searching.

A schema is how you tell Weaviate:

what embedding model should be used to vectorize the data
what your data is made of (property names and types)
which properties should be vectorized and indexed
In this cookbook we will use a dataset for Articles, which contains:

title
content
url
We want to vectorize title and content, but not the url.

To vectorize and query the data, we will use text-embedding-3-small.

# Clear up the schema, so that we can recreate it
client.schema.delete_all()
client.schema.get()

# Define the Schema object to use `text-embedding-3-small` on `title` and `content`, but skip it for `url`
article_schema = {
    "class": "Article",
    "description": "A collection of articles",
    "vectorizer": "text2vec-openai",
    "moduleConfig": {
        "text2vec-openai": {
          "model": "ada",
          "modelVersion": "002",
          "type": "text"
        }
    },
    "properties": [{
        "name": "title",
        "description": "Title of the article",
        "dataType": ["string"]
    },
    {
        "name": "content",
        "description": "Contents of the article",
        "dataType": ["text"]
    },
    {
        "name": "url",
        "description": "URL to the article",
        "dataType": ["string"],
        "moduleConfig": { "text2vec-openai": { "skip": True } }
    }]
}

# add the Article schema
client.schema.create_class(article_schema)

# get the schema to make sure it worked
client.schema.get()

Import data
In this section we will:

load the Simple Wikipedia dataset
configure Weaviate Batch import (to make the import more efficient)
import the data into Weaviate
Note: Like mentioned before. We don't need to manually vectorize the data. The text2vec-openai module will take care of that.

### STEP 1 - load the dataset

from datasets import load_dataset
from typing import List, Iterator

# We'll use the datasets library to pull the Simple Wikipedia dataset for embedding
dataset = list(load_dataset("wikipedia", "20220301.simple")["train"])

# For testing, limited to 2.5k articles for demo purposes
dataset = dataset[:2_500]

# Limited to 25k articles for larger demo purposes
# dataset = dataset[:25_000]

# for free OpenAI acounts, you can use 50 objects
# dataset = dataset[:50]

### Step 2 - configure Weaviate Batch, with
# - starting batch size of 100
# - dynamically increase/decrease based on performance
# - add timeout retries if something goes wrong

client.batch.configure(
    batch_size=10, 
    dynamic=True,
    timeout_retries=3,
#   callback=None,
)

### Step 3 - import data

print("Importing Articles")

counter=0

with client.batch as batch:
    for article in dataset:
        if (counter %10 == 0):
            print(f"Import {counter} / {len(dataset)} ")

        properties = {
            "title": article["title"],
            "content": article["text"],
            "url": article["url"]
        }
        
        batch.add_data_object(properties, "Article")
        counter = counter+1

print("Importing Articles complete")       

# Test that all data has loaded – get object count
result = (
    client.query.aggregate("Article")
    .with_fields("meta { count }")
    .do()
)
print("Object count: ", result["data"]["Aggregate"]["Article"], "\n")

# Test one article has worked by checking one object
test_article = (
    client.query
    .get("Article", ["title", "url", "content"])
    .with_limit(1)
    .do()
)["data"]["Get"]["Article"][0]

print(test_article['title'])
print(test_article['url'])
print(test_article['content'])

Search Data
As above, we'll fire some queries at our new Index and get back results based on the closeness to our existing vectors

Learn more about the alpha setting here

def hybrid_query_weaviate(query, collection_name, alpha_val):
    
    nearText = {
        "concepts": [query],
        "distance": 0.7,
    }

    properties = [
        "title", "content", "url",
        "_additional { score }"
    ]

    result = (
        client.query
        .get(collection_name, properties)
        .with_hybrid(nearText, alpha=alpha_val)
        .with_limit(10)
        .do()
    )
    
    # Check for errors
    if ("errors" in result):
        print ("\033[91mYou probably have run out of OpenAI API calls for the current minute – the limit is set at 60 per minute.")
        raise Exception(result["errors"][0]['message'])
    
    return result["data"]["Get"][collection_name]

query_result = hybrid_query_weaviate("modern art in Europe", "Article", 0.5)

for i, article in enumerate(query_result):
    print(f"{i+1}. { article['title']} (Score: {article['_additional']['score']})")

query_result = hybrid_query_weaviate("Famous battles in Scottish history", "Article", 0.5)

for i, article in enumerate(query_result):
    print(f"{i+1}. { article['title']} (Score: {article['_additional']['score']})")
his notebook presents how to implement a Question Answering system with Langchain, Qdrant as a knowledge based and OpenAI embeddings. If you are not familiar with Qdrant, it's better to check out the Getting_started_with_Qdrant_and_OpenAI.ipynb notebook.

This notebook presents an end-to-end process of:

Calculating the embeddings with OpenAI API.
Storing the embeddings in a local instance of Qdrant to build a knowledge base.
Converting raw text query to an embedding with OpenAI API.
Using Qdrant to perform the nearest neighbour search in the created collection to find some context.
Asking LLM to find the answer in a given context.
All the steps will be simplified to calling some corresponding Langchain methods.

Prerequisites
For the purposes of this exercise we need to prepare a couple of things:

Qdrant server instance. In our case a local Docker container.
The qdrant-client library to interact with the vector database.
Langchain as a framework.
An OpenAI API key.
Start Qdrant server
We're going to use a local Qdrant instance running in a Docker container. The easiest way to launch it is to use the attached [docker-compose.yaml] file and run the following command:

! docker-compose up -d

Starting qdrant_qdrant_1 ... 
[1Bting qdrant_qdrant_1 ... [32mdone[0m
We might validate if the server was launched successfully by running a simple curl command:

! curl http://localhost:6333

{"title":"qdrant - vector search engine","version":"1.0.1"}
Install requirements
This notebook obviously requires the openai, langchain and qdrant-client packages.

! pip install openai qdrant-client "langchain==0.0.100" wget

Prepare your OpenAI API key
The OpenAI API key is used for vectorization of the documents and queries.

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.

Once you get your key, please add it to your environment variables as OPENAI_API_KEY by running following command:

! export OPENAI_API_KEY="your API key"

# Test that your OpenAI API key is correctly set as an environment variable
# Note. if you run this notebook locally, you will need to reload your terminal and the notebook for the env variables to be live.
import os

# Note. alternatively you can set a temporary env variable like this:
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") is not None:
    print("OPENAI_API_KEY is ready")
else:
    print("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found")

OPENAI_API_KEY is ready
Load data
In this section we are going to load the data containing some natural questions and answers to them. All the data will be used to create a Langchain application with Qdrant being the knowledge base.

import wget

# All the examples come from https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions

Chain definition
Langchain is already integrated with Qdrant and performs all the indexing for given list of documents. In our case we are going to store the set of answers we have.

from langchain.vectorstores import Qdrant
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain import VectorDBQA, OpenAI

embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
doc_store = Qdrant.from_texts(
    answers, embeddings, host="localhost" 
)

At this stage all the possible answers are already stored in Qdrant, so we can define the whole QA chain.

llm = OpenAI()
qa = VectorDBQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm, 
    chain_type="stuff", 
    vectorstore=doc_store,
    return_source_documents=False,
)

Search data
Once the data is put into Qdrant we can start asking some questions. A question will be automatically vectorized by OpenAI model, and the created vector will be used to find some possibly matching answers in Qdrant. Once retrieved, the most similar answers will be incorporated into the prompt sent to OpenAI Large Language Model. The communication between all the services is shown on a graph:



import random

random.seed(52)
selected_questions = random.choices(questions, k=5)

for question in selected_questions:
    print(">", question)
    print(qa.run(question), end="\n\n")

> properties of red black tree in data structure
 Red black trees are a type of binary tree with a special set of properties. Each node is either red or black, the root is black, and if a node is red, then both its children are black. Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains the same number of black nodes. The number of black nodes from the root to a node is the node's black depth, and the uniform number of black nodes in all paths from root to the leaves is called the black-height of the red-black tree.

Custom prompt templates
The stuff chain type in Langchain uses a specific prompt with question and context documents incorporated. This is what the default prompt looks like:

Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.
{context}
Question: {question}
Helpful Answer:

We can, however, provide our prompt template and change the behaviour of the OpenAI LLM, while still using the stuff chain type. It is important to keep {context} and {question} as placeholders.

Experimenting with custom prompts
We can try using a different prompt template, so the model:

Responds with a single-sentence answer if it knows it.
Suggests a random song title if it doesn't know the answer to our question.
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

custom_prompt = """
Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end. Please provide
a short single-sentence summary answer only. If you don't know the answer or if it's 
not present in given context, don't try to make up an answer, but suggest me a random 
unrelated song title I could listen to.

GPT-3 can help us extract key figures, dates or other bits of important content from documents that are too big to fit into the context window. One approach for solving this is to chunk the document up and process each chunk separately, before combining into one list of answers.

In this notebook we'll run through this approach:

Load in a long PDF and pull the text out
Create a prompt to be used to extract key bits of information
Chunk up our document and process each chunk to pull any answers out
Combine them at the end
This simple approach will then be extended to three more difficult questions
Approach
Setup: Take a PDF, a Formula 1 Financial Regulation document on Power Units, and extract the text from it for entity extraction. We'll use this to try to extract answers that are buried in the content.
Simple Entity Extraction: Extract key bits of information from chunks of a document by:
Creating a template prompt with our questions and an example of the format it expects
Create a function to take a chunk of text as input, combine with the prompt and get a response
Run a script to chunk the text, extract answers and output them for parsing
Complex Entity Extraction: Ask some more difficult questions which require tougher reasoning to work out
Setup
!pip install textract
!pip install tiktoken

Consolidation
We've been able to extract the first two answers safely, while the third was confounded by the date that appeared on every page, though the correct answer is in there as well.

To tune this further you can consider experimenting with:

A more descriptive or specific prompt
If you have sufficient training data, fine-tuning a model to find a set of outputs very well
The way you chunk your data - we have gone for 1000 tokens with no overlap, but more intelligent chunking that breaks info into sections, cuts by tokens or similar may get better results
However, with minimal tuning we have now answered 6 questions of varying difficulty using the contents of a long document, and have a reusable approach that we can apply to any long document requiring entity extraction. Look forward to seeing what you can do with this!
ChatGPT is powered by gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4, OpenAI's most advanced models.

You can build your own applications with gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4 using the OpenAI API.

Chat models take a series of messages as input, and return an AI-written message as output.

This guide illustrates the chat format with a few example API calls.

1. Import the openai library
# if needed, install and/or upgrade to the latest version of the OpenAI Python library
%pip install --upgrade openai

# import the OpenAI Python library for calling the OpenAI API
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))

2. An example chat completion API call
A chat completion API call parameters, Required

model: the name of the model you want to use (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-1106)
messages: a list of message objects, where each object has two required fields:
role: the role of the messenger (either system, user, assistant or tool)
content: the content of the message (e.g., Write me a beautiful poem)
Messages can also contain an optional name field, which give the messenger a name. E.g., example-user, Alice, BlackbeardBot. Names may not contain spaces.

Optional

frequency_penalty: Penalizes tokens based on their frequency, reducing repetition.
logit_bias: Modifies likelihood of specified tokens with bias values.
logprobs: Returns log probabilities of output tokens if true.
top_logprobs: Specifies the number of most likely tokens to return at each position.
max_tokens: Sets the maximum number of generated tokens in chat completion.
n: Generates a specified number of chat completion choices for each input.
presence_penalty: Penalizes new tokens based on their presence in the text.
response_format: Specifies the output format, e.g., JSON mode.
seed: Ensures deterministic sampling with a specified seed.
stop: Specifies up to 4 sequences where the API should stop generating tokens.
stream: Sends partial message deltas as tokens become available.
temperature: Sets the sampling temperature between 0 and 2.
top_p: Uses nucleus sampling; considers tokens with top_p probability mass.
tools: Lists functions the model may call.
tool_choice: Controls the model's function calls (none/auto/function).
user: Unique identifier for end-user monitoring and abuse detection.
As of January 2024, you can also optionally submit a list of functions that tell GPT whether it can generate JSON to feed into a function. For details, see the documentation, API reference, or the Cookbook guide How to call functions with chat models.

Typically, a conversation will start with a system message that tells the assistant how to behave, followed by alternating user and assistant messages, but you are not required to follow this format.

Let's look at an example chat API calls to see how the chat format works in practice.

# Example OpenAI Python library request
MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Knock knock."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Who's there?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Orange."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(json.dumps(json.loads(response.model_dump_json()), indent=4))

{
    "id": "chatcmpl-8dee9DuEFcg2QILtT2a6EBXZnpirM",
    "choices": [
        {
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "index": 0,
            "logprobs": null,
            "message": {
                "content": "Orange who?",
                "role": "assistant",
                "function_call": null,
                "tool_calls": null
            }
        }
    ],
    "created": 1704461729,
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "system_fingerprint": null,
    "usage": {
        "completion_tokens": 3,
        "prompt_tokens": 35,
        "total_tokens": 38
    }
}
As you can see, the response object has a few fields:

id: the ID of the request
choices: a list of completion objects (only one, unless you set n greater than 1)
finish_reason: the reason the model stopped generating text (either stop, or length if max_tokens limit was reached)
index: The index of the choice in the list of choices.
logprobs: Log probability information for the choice.
message: the message object generated by the model
content: content of message
role: The role of the author of this message.
tool_calls: The tool calls generated by the model, such as function calls. if the tools is given
created: the timestamp of the request
model: the full name of the model used to generate the response
object: the type of object returned (e.g., chat.completion)
system_fingerprint: This fingerprint represents the backend configuration that the model runs with.
usage: the number of tokens used to generate the replies, counting prompt, completion, and total
Extract just the reply with:

response.choices[0].message.content

'Orange who?'
Even non-conversation-based tasks can fit into the chat format, by placing the instruction in the first user message.

For example, to ask the model to explain asynchronous programming in the style of the pirate Blackbeard, we can structure conversation as follows:

# example with a system message
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain asynchronous programming in the style of the pirate Blackbeard."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

Arr, me matey! Let me tell ye a tale of asynchronous programming, in the style of the fearsome pirate Blackbeard!

Picture this, me hearties. In the vast ocean of programming, there be times when ye need to perform multiple tasks at once. But fear not, for asynchronous programming be here to save the day!

Ye see, in traditional programming, ye be waitin' for one task to be done before movin' on to the next. But with asynchronous programming, ye can be takin' care of multiple tasks at the same time, just like a pirate multitaskin' on the high seas!

Instead of waitin' for a task to be completed, ye can be sendin' it off on its own journey, while ye move on to the next task. It be like havin' a crew of trusty sailors, each takin' care of their own duties, without waitin' for the others.

Now, ye may be wonderin', how does this sorcery work? Well, me matey, it be all about callbacks and promises. When ye be sendin' off a task, ye be attachin' a callback function to it. This be like leavin' a message in a bottle, tellin' the task what to do when it be finished.

While the task be sailin' on its own, ye can be movin' on to the next task, without wastin' any precious time. And when the first task be done, it be sendin' a signal back to ye, lettin' ye know it be finished. Then ye can be takin' care of the callback function, like openin' the bottle and readin' the message inside.

But wait, there be more! With promises, ye can be makin' even fancier arrangements. Instead of callbacks, ye be makin' a promise that the task will be completed. It be like a contract between ye and the task, swearin' that it will be done.

Ye can be attachin' multiple promises to a task, promisin' different outcomes. And when the task be finished, it be fulfillin' the promises, lettin' ye know it be done. Then ye can be handlin' the fulfillments, like collectin' the rewards of yer pirate adventures!

So, me hearties, that be the tale of asynchronous programming, told in the style of the fearsome pirate Blackbeard! With callbacks and promises, ye can be takin' care of multiple tasks at once, just like a pirate conquerin' the seven seas!
# example without a system message
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain asynchronous programming in the style of the pirate Blackbeard."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

Arr, me hearties! Gather 'round and listen up, for I be tellin' ye about the mysterious art of asynchronous programming, in the style of the fearsome pirate Blackbeard!

Now, ye see, in the world of programming, there be times when we need to perform tasks that take a mighty long time to complete. These tasks might involve fetchin' data from the depths of the internet, or performin' complex calculations that would make even Davy Jones scratch his head.

In the olden days, we pirates used to wait patiently for each task to finish afore movin' on to the next one. But that be a waste of precious time, me hearties! We be pirates, always lookin' for ways to be more efficient and plunder more booty!

That be where asynchronous programming comes in, me mateys. It be a way to tackle multiple tasks at once, without waitin' for each one to finish afore movin' on. It be like havin' a crew of scallywags workin' on different tasks simultaneously, while ye be overseein' the whole operation.

Ye see, in asynchronous programming, we be breakin' down our tasks into smaller chunks called "coroutines." Each coroutine be like a separate pirate, workin' on its own task. When a coroutine be startin' its work, it don't wait for the task to finish afore movin' on to the next one. Instead, it be movin' on to the next task, lettin' the first one continue in the background.

Now, ye might be wonderin', "But Blackbeard, how be we know when a task be finished if we don't wait for it?" Ah, me hearties, that be where the magic of callbacks and promises come in!

When a coroutine be startin' its work, it be attachin' a callback or a promise to it. This be like leavin' a message in a bottle, tellin' the coroutine what to do when it be finished. So, while the coroutine be workin' away, the rest of the crew be movin' on to other tasks, plunderin' more booty along the way.

When a coroutine be finished with its task, it be sendin' a signal to the callback or fulfillin' the promise, lettin' the rest of the crew know that it be done. Then, the crew can gather 'round and handle the results of the completed task, celebratin' their victory and countin' their plunder.

So, me hearties, asynchronous programming be like havin' a crew of pirates workin' on different tasks at once, without waitin' for each one to finish afore movin' on. It be a way to be more efficient, plunder more booty, and conquer the vast seas of programming!

Now, set sail, me mateys, and embrace the power of asynchronous programming like true pirates of the digital realm! Arr!
3. Tips for instructing gpt-3.5-turbo-0301
Best practices for instructing models may change from model version to model version. The advice that follows applies to gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 and may not apply to future models.

System messages
The system message can be used to prime the assistant with different personalities or behaviors.

Be aware that gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 does not generally pay as much attention to the system message as gpt-4-0314 or gpt-3.5-turbo-0613. Therefore, for gpt-3.5-turbo-0301, we recommend placing important instructions in the user message instead. Some developers have found success in continually moving the system message near the end of the conversation to keep the model's attention from drifting away as conversations get longer.

# An example of a system message that primes the assistant to explain concepts in great depth
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a friendly and helpful teaching assistant. You explain concepts in great depth using simple terms, and you give examples to help people learn. At the end of each explanation, you ask a question to check for understanding"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain how fractions work?"},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

Of course! Fractions are a way to represent parts of a whole. They are made up of two numbers: a numerator and a denominator. The numerator tells you how many parts you have, and the denominator tells you how many equal parts make up the whole.

Let's take an example to understand this better. Imagine you have a pizza that is divided into 8 equal slices. If you eat 3 slices, you can represent that as the fraction 3/8. Here, the numerator is 3 because you ate 3 slices, and the denominator is 8 because the whole pizza is divided into 8 slices.

Fractions can also be used to represent numbers less than 1. For example, if you eat half of a pizza, you can write it as 1/2. Here, the numerator is 1 because you ate one slice, and the denominator is 2 because the whole pizza is divided into 2 equal parts.

Now, let's talk about equivalent fractions. Equivalent fractions are different fractions that represent the same amount. For example, 1/2 and 2/4 are equivalent fractions because they both represent half of something. To find equivalent fractions, you can multiply or divide both the numerator and denominator by the same number.

Here's a question to check your understanding: If you have a cake divided into 12 equal slices and you eat 4 slices, what fraction of the cake did you eat?
# An example of a system message that primes the assistant to give brief, to-the-point answers
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a laconic assistant. You reply with brief, to-the-point answers with no elaboration."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain how fractions work?"},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

Fractions represent parts of a whole. They have a numerator (top number) and a denominator (bottom number).
Few-shot prompting
In some cases, it's easier to show the model what you want rather than tell the model what you want.

One way to show the model what you want is with faked example messages.

For example:

# An example of a faked few-shot conversation to prime the model into translating business jargon to simpler speech
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful, pattern-following assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Help me translate the following corporate jargon into plain English."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to!"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "New synergies will help drive top-line growth."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Things working well together will increase revenue."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Let's circle back when we have more bandwidth to touch base on opportunities for increased leverage."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's talk later when we're less busy about how to do better."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "This late pivot means we don't have time to boil the ocean for the client deliverable."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

This sudden change in direction means we don't have enough time to complete the entire project for the client.
To help clarify that the example messages are not part of a real conversation, and shouldn't be referred back to by the model, you can try setting the name field of system messages to example_user and example_assistant.

Transforming the few-shot example above, we could write:

# The business jargon translation example, but with example names for the example messages
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=MODEL,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful, pattern-following assistant that translates corporate jargon into plain English."},
        {"role": "system", "name":"example_user", "content": "New synergies will help drive top-line growth."},
        {"role": "system", "name": "example_assistant", "content": "Things working well together will increase revenue."},
        {"role": "system", "name":"example_user", "content": "Let's circle back when we have more bandwidth to touch base on opportunities for increased leverage."},
        {"role": "system", "name": "example_assistant", "content": "Let's talk later when we're less busy about how to do better."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "This late pivot means we don't have time to boil the ocean for the client deliverable."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

This sudden change in direction means we don't have enough time to complete the entire project for the client.
Not every attempt at engineering conversations will succeed at first.

If your first attempts fail, don't be afraid to experiment with different ways of priming or conditioning the model.

As an example, one developer discovered an increase in accuracy when they inserted a user message that said "Great job so far, these have been perfect" to help condition the model into providing higher quality responses.

For more ideas on how to lift the reliability of the models, consider reading our guide on techniques to increase reliability. It was written for non-chat models, but many of its principles still apply.

4. Counting tokens
When you submit your request, the API transforms the messages into a sequence of tokens.

The number of tokens used affects:

the cost of the request
the time it takes to generate the response
when the reply gets cut off from hitting the maximum token limit (4,096 for gpt-3.5-turbo or 8,192 for gpt-4)
You can use the following function to count the number of tokens that a list of messages will use.

Note that the exact way that tokens are counted from messages may change from model to model. Consider the counts from the function below an estimate, not a timeless guarantee.

In particular, requests that use the optional functions input will consume extra tokens on top of the estimates calculated below.

Read more about counting tokens in How to count tokens with tiktoken.

import tiktoken


def num_tokens_from_messages(messages, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613"):
    """Return the number of tokens used by a list of messages."""
    try:
        encoding = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(model)

 ["Deployments"]
In this section we are going to create a deployment of a GPT model that we can use to create chat completions.

Deployments: Create in the Azure OpenAI Studio
Let's deploy a model to use with chat completions. Go to https://portal.azure.com, find your Azure OpenAI resource, and then navigate to the Azure OpenAI Studio. Click on the "Deployments" tab and then create a deployment for the model you want to use for chat completions. The deployment name that you give the model will be used in the code below.

deployment = "" # Fill in the deployment name from the portal here  
["Create chat completions"]
Now let's create a chat completion using the client we built.

# For all possible arguments see https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat-completions/create
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=deployment,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Knock knock."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Who's there?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Orange."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
)

print(f"{response.choices[0].message.role}: {response.choices[0].message.content}")

Create a streaming chat completion
We can also stream the response.

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=deployment,
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Knock knock."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Who's there?"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Orange."},
    ],
    temperature=0,
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response:
    if len(chunk.choices) > 0:
        delta = chunk.choices[0].delta

        if delta.role:
            print(delta.role + ": ", end="", flush=True)
        if delta.content:
            print(delta.content, end="", flush=True)

Content filtering
Azure OpenAI service includes content filtering of prompts and completion responses. You can learn more about content filtering and how to configure it here.

If the prompt is flagged by the content filter, the library will raise a BadRequestError exception with a content_filter error code. Otherwise, you can access the prompt_filter_results and content_filter_results on the response to see the results of the content filtering and what categories were flagged.

Prompt flagged by content filter
import json

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "<text violating the content policy>"}
]

try:
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=messages,
        model=deployment,
    )
except openai.BadRequestError as e:
    err = json.loads(e.response.text)
    if err["error"]["code"] == "content_filter":
        print("Content filter triggered!")
        content_filter_result = err["error"]["innererror"]["content_filter_result"]
        for category, details in content_filter_result.items():
            print(f"{category}:\n filtered={details['filtered']}\n severity={details['severity']}")

Checking the result of the content filter
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the biggest city in Washington?"}
]

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=messages,
    model=deployment,
)
print(f"Answer: {completion.choices[0].message.content}")

# prompt content filter result in "model_extra" for azure
prompt_filter_result = completion.model_extra["prompt_filter_results"][0]["content_filter_results"]
print("\nPrompt content filter results:")
for category, details in prompt_filter_result.items():
    print(f"{category}:\n filtered={details['filtered']}\n severity={details['severity']}")

# completion content filter result
print("\nCompletion content filter results:")
completion_filter_result = completion.choices[0].model_extra["content_filter_results"]
for category, details in completion_filter_result.items():
    print(f"{category}:\n filtered={details['filtered']}\n severity={details['severity']}")

Question Answering with LLMs
Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT can be used to answer questions about data that the model may not have been trained on, or have access to. For example;

Personal data like e-mails and notes
Highly specialized data like archival or legal documents
Newly created data like recent news stories
In order to overcome this limitation, we can use a data store which is amenable to querying in natural language, just like the LLM itself. An embeddings store like Chroma represents documents as embeddings, alongside the documents themselves.

By embedding a text query, Chroma can find relevant documents, which we can then pass to the LLM to answer our question. We'll show detailed examples and variants of this approach.

Setup and preliminaries
First we make sure the python dependencies we need are installed.

%pip install -qU openai chromadb pandas

Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
We use OpenAI's API's throughout this notebook. You can get an API key from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

You can add your API key as an environment variable by executing the command export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx in a terminal. Note that you will need to reload the notebook if the environment variable wasn't set yet. Alternatively, you can set it in the notebook, see below.

import os

# Uncomment the following line to set the environment variable in the notebook
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = 'sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'

if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") is not None:
    print("OPENAI_API_KEY is ready")
    import openai
    openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
else:
    print("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found")

OPENAI_API_KEY is ready
Dataset
Throughout this notebook, we use the SciFact dataset. This is a curated dataset of expert annotated scientific claims, with an accompanying text corpus of paper titles and abstracts. Each claim may be supported, contradicted, or not have enough evidence either way, according to the documents in the corpus.

Having the corpus available as ground-truth allows us to investigate how well the following approaches to LLM question answering perform.

# Load the claim dataset
import pandas as pd

data_path = '../../data'

claim_df = pd.read_json(f'{data_path}/scifact_claims.jsonl', lines=True)
claim_df.head()

Just asking the model
GPT-3.5 was trained on a large amount of scientific information. As a baseline, we'd like to understand what the model already knows without any further context. This will allow us to calibrate overall performance.

We construct an appropriate prompt, with some example facts, then query the model with each claim in the dataset. We ask the model to assess a claim as 'True', 'False', or 'NEE' if there is not enough evidence one way or the other.

def build_prompt(claim):
    return [
        {"role": "system", "content": "I will ask you to assess a scientific claim. Output only the text 'True' if the claim is true, 'False' if the claim is false, or 'NEE' if there's not enough evidence."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"""        
Example:

Claim:
0-dimensional biomaterials show inductive properties.

Assessment:
False

Claim:
1/2000 in UK have abnormal PrP positivity.

Assessment:
True

Claim:
Aspirin inhibits the production of PGE2.

Assessment:
False

End of examples. Assess the following claim:

Claim:
{claim}

Assessment:
"""}
    ]


def assess_claims(claims):
    responses = []
    # Query the OpenAI API
    for claim in claims:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
            messages=build_prompt(claim),
            max_tokens=3,
        )
        # Strip any punctuation or whitespace from the response
        responses.append(response.choices[0].message.content.strip('., '))

    return responses

We sample 100 claims from the dataset

# Let's take a look at 100 claims
samples = claim_df.sample(50)

claims = samples['claim'].tolist() 

We evaluate the ground-truth according to the dataset. From the dataset description, each claim is either supported or contradicted by the evidence, or else there isn't enough evidence either way.

def get_groundtruth(evidence):
    groundtruth = []
    for e in evidence:
        # Evidence is empty 
        if len(e) == 0:
            groundtruth.append('NEE')
        else:
            # In this dataset, all evidence for a given claim is consistent, either SUPPORT or CONTRADICT
            if list(e.values())[0][0]['label'] == 'SUPPORT':
                groundtruth.append('True')
            else:
                groundtruth.append('False')
    return groundtruth

evidence = samples['evidence'].tolist()
groundtruth = get_groundtruth(evidence)

We also output the confusion matrix, comparing the model's assessments with the ground truth, in an easy to read table.

def confusion_matrix(inferred, groundtruth):
    assert len(inferred) == len(groundtruth)
    confusion = {
        'True': {'True': 0, 'False': 0, 'NEE': 0},
        'False': {'True': 0, 'False': 0, 'NEE': 0},
        'NEE': {'True': 0, 'False': 0, 'NEE': 0},
    }
    for i, g in zip(inferred, groundtruth):
        confusion[i][g] += 1

    # Pretty print the confusion matrix
    print('\tGroundtruth')
    print('\tTrue\tFalse\tNEE')
    for i in confusion:
        print(i, end='\t')
        for g in confusion[i]:
            print(confusion[i][g], end='\t')
        print()

    return confusion

We ask the model to directly assess the claims, without additional context.

gpt_inferred = assess_claims(claims)
confusion_matrix(gpt_inferred, groundtruth)

	Groundtruth
	True	False	NEE
True	15	5	14	
False	0	2	1	
NEE	3	3	7	
{'True': {'True': 15, 'False': 5, 'NEE': 14},
 'False': {'True': 0, 'False': 2, 'NEE': 1},
 'NEE': {'True': 3, 'False': 3, 'NEE': 7}}
Results
From these results we see that the LLM is strongly biased to assess claims as true, even when they are false, and also tends to assess false claims as not having enough evidence. Note that 'not enough evidence' is with respect to the model's assessment of the claim in a vacuum, without additional context.

Adding context
We now add the additional context available from the corpus of paper titles and abstracts. This section shows how to load a text corpus into Chroma, using OpenAI text embeddings.

First, we load the text corpus.

# Load the corpus into a dataframe
corpus_df = pd.read_json(f'{data_path}/scifact_corpus.jsonl', lines=True)
corpus_df.head()

Loading the corpus into Chroma
The next step is to load the corpus into Chroma. Given an embedding function, Chroma will automatically handle embedding each document, and will store it alongside its text and metadata, making it simple to query.

We instantiate a (ephemeral) Chroma client, and create a collection for the SciFact title and abstract corpus. Chroma can also be instantiated in a persisted configuration; learn more at the Chroma docs.

import chromadb
from chromadb.utils.embedding_functions import OpenAIEmbeddingFunction

# We initialize an embedding function, and provide it to the collection.
embedding_function = OpenAIEmbeddingFunction(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

chroma_client = chromadb.Client() # Ephemeral by default
scifact_corpus_collection = chroma_client.create_collection(name='scifact_corpus', embedding_function=embedding_function)

Running Chroma using direct local API.
Using DuckDB in-memory for database. Data will be transient.
Next we load the corpus into Chroma. Because this data loading is memory intensive, we recommend using a batched loading scheme in batches of 50-1000. For this example it should take just over one minute for the entire corpus. It's being embedded in the background, automatically, using the embedding_function we specified earlier.

batch_size = 100

for i in range(0, len(corpus_df), batch_size):
    batch_df = corpus_df[i:i+batch_size]
    scifact_corpus_collection.add(
        ids=batch_df['doc_id'].apply(lambda x: str(x)).tolist(), # Chroma takes string IDs.
        documents=(batch_df['title'] + '. ' + batch_df['abstract'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x))).to_list(), # We concatenate the title and abstract.
        metadatas=[{"structured": structured} for structured in batch_df['structured'].to_list()] # We also store the metadata, though we don't use it in this example.
    )

Retrieving context
Next we retrieve documents from the corpus which may be relevant to each claim in our sample. We want to provide these as context to the LLM for evaluating the claims. We retrieve the 3 most relevant documents for each claim, according to the embedding distance.

claim_query_result = scifact_corpus_collection.query(query_texts=claims, include=['documents', 'distances'], n_results=3)

We create a new prompt, this time taking into account the additional context we retrieve from the corpus.

def build_prompt_with_context(claim, context):
    return [{'role': 'system', 'content': "I will ask you to assess whether a particular scientific claim, based on evidence provided. Output only the text 'True' if the claim is true, 'False' if the claim is false, or 'NEE' if there's not enough evidence."}, 
            {'role': 'user', 'content': f""""
The evidence is the following:

{' '.join(context)}

Assess the following claim on the basis of the evidence. Output only the text 'True' if the claim is true, 'False' if the claim is false, or 'NEE' if there's not enough evidence. Do not output any other text. 

Claim:
{claim}

Assessment:
"""}]


def assess_claims_with_context(claims, contexts):
    responses = []
    # Query the OpenAI API
    for claim, context in zip(claims, contexts):
        # If no evidence is provided, return NEE
        if len(context) == 0:
            responses.append('NEE')
            continue
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model='gpt-3.5-turbo',
            messages=build_prompt_with_context(claim=claim, context=context),
            max_tokens=3,
        )
        # Strip any punctuation or whitespace from the response
        responses.append(response.choices[0].message.content.strip('., '))

    return responses

Then ask the model to evaluate the claims with the retrieved context.

gpt_with_context_evaluation = assess_claims_with_context(claims, claim_query_result['documents'])
confusion_matrix(gpt_with_context_evaluation, groundtruth)

	Groundtruth
	True	False	NEE
True	16	2	8	
False	1	6	5	
NEE	1	2	9	
{'True': {'True': 16, 'False': 2, 'NEE': 8},
 'False': {'True': 1, 'False': 6, 'NEE': 5},
 'NEE': {'True': 1, 'False': 2, 'NEE': 9}}
Results
We see that the model is a lot less likely to evaluate a False claim as true (2 instances VS 5 previously), but that claims without enough evidence are still often assessed as True or False.

Taking a look at the retrieved documents, we see that they are sometimes not relevant to the claim - this causes the model to be confused by the extra information, and it may decide that sufficient evidence is present, even when the information is irrelevant. This happens because we always ask for the 3 'most' relevant documents, but these might not be relevant at all beyond a certain point.

Filtering context on relevance
Along with the documents themselves, Chroma returns a distance score. We can try thresholding on distance, so that fewer irrelevant documents make it into the context we provide the model.

If, after filtering on the threshold, no context documents remain, we bypass the model and simply return that there is not enough evidence.

def filter_query_result(query_result, distance_threshold=0.25):
# For each query result, retain only the documents whose distance is below the threshold
    for ids, docs, distances in zip(query_result['ids'], query_result['documents'], query_result['distances']):
        for i in range(len(ids)-1, -1, -1):
            if distances[i] > distance_threshold:
                ids.pop(i)
                docs.pop(i)
                distances.pop(i)
    return query_result

filtered_claim_query_result = filter_query_result(claim_query_result)

Now we assess the claims using this cleaner context.

gpt_with_filtered_context_evaluation = assess_claims_with_context(claims, filtered_claim_query_result['documents'])
confusion_matrix(gpt_with_filtered_context_evaluation, groundtruth)

	Groundtruth
	True	False	NEE
True	10	2	1	
False	0	2	1	
NEE	8	6	20	
{'True': {'True': 10, 'False': 2, 'NEE': 1},
 'False': {'True': 0, 'False': 2, 'NEE': 1},
 'NEE': {'True': 8, 'False': 6, 'NEE': 20}}
Results
The model now assesses many fewer claims as True or False when there is not enough evidence present. However, it now biases away from certainty. Most claims are now assessed as having not enough evidence, because a large fraction of them are filtered out by the distance threshold. It's possible to tune the distance threshold to find the optimal operating point, but this can be difficult, and is dataset and embedding model dependent.

We want to be able to retrieve relevant documents, without retrieving less relevant ones which might confuse the model. One way to accomplish this is to improve the retrieval query.

Until now, we have queried the dataset using claims which are single sentence statements, while the corpus contains abstracts describing a scientific paper. Intuitively, while these might be related, there are significant differences in their structure and meaning. These differences are encoded by the embedding model, and so influence the distances between the query and the most relevant results.

We can overcome this by leveraging the power of LLMs to generate relevant text. While the facts might be hallucinated, the content and structure of the documents the models generate is more similar to the documents in our corpus, than the queries are. This could lead to better queries and hence better results.

This approach is called Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE), and has been shown to be quite good at the retrieval task. It should help us bring more relevant information into the context, without polluting it.

TL;DR:

you get much better matches when you embed whole abstracts rather than single sentences
but claims are usually single sentences
So HyDE shows that using GPT3 to expand claims into hallucinated abstracts and then searching based on those abstracts works (claims -> abstracts -> results) better than searching directly (claims -> results)
First, we use in-context examples to prompt the model to generate documents similar to what's in the corpus, for each claim we want to assess.

def build_hallucination_prompt(claim):
    return [{'role': 'system', 'content': """I will ask you to write an abstract for a scientific paper which supports or refutes a given claim. It should be written in scientific language, include a title. Output only one abstract, then stop.
    
    An Example:

    Claim:
    A high microerythrocyte count raises vulnerability to severe anemia in homozygous alpha (+)- thalassemia trait subjects.

    Abstract:
    BACKGROUND The heritable haemoglobinopathy alpha(+)-thalassaemia is caused by the reduced synthesis of alpha-globin chains that form part of normal adult haemoglobin (Hb). Individuals homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia have microcytosis and an increased erythrocyte count. Alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity confers considerable protection against severe malaria, including severe malarial anaemia (SMA) (Hb concentration < 50 g/l), but does not influence parasite count. We tested the hypothesis that the erythrocyte indices associated with alpha(+)-thalassaemia homozygosity provide a haematological benefit during acute malaria.   
    METHODS AND FINDINGS Data from children living on the north coast of Papua New Guinea who had participated in a case-control study of the protection afforded by alpha(+)-thalassaemia against severe malaria were reanalysed to assess the genotype-specific reduction in erythrocyte count and Hb levels associated with acute malarial disease. We observed a reduction in median erythrocyte count of approximately 1.5 x 10(12)/l in all children with acute falciparum malaria relative to values in community children (p < 0.001). We developed a simple mathematical model of the linear relationship between Hb concentration and erythrocyte count. This model predicted that children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia lose less Hb than children of normal genotype for a reduction in erythrocyte count of >1.1 x 10(12)/l as a result of the reduced mean cell Hb in homozygous alpha(+)-thalassaemia. In addition, children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia require a 10% greater reduction in erythrocyte count than children of normal genotype (p = 0.02) for Hb concentration to fall to 50 g/l, the cutoff for SMA. We estimated that the haematological profile in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia reduces the risk of SMA during acute malaria compared to children of normal genotype (relative risk 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-1.12, p = 0.09).   
    CONCLUSIONS The increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis in children homozygous for alpha(+)-thalassaemia may contribute substantially to their protection against SMA. A lower concentration of Hb per erythrocyte and a larger population of erythrocytes may be a biologically advantageous strategy against the significant reduction in erythrocyte count that occurs during acute infection with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This haematological profile may reduce the risk of anaemia by other Plasmodium species, as well as other causes of anaemia. Other host polymorphisms that induce an increased erythrocyte count and microcytosis may confer a similar advantage.

    End of example.

Deployment options
Using AnalyticDB Cloud Vector Database. Click here to fast deploy it.
Prerequisites
For the purposes of this exercise we need to prepare a couple of things:

AnalyticDB cloud server instance.
The 'psycopg2' library to interact with the vector database. Any other postgresql client library is ok.
An OpenAI API key.
We might validate if the server was launched successfully by running a simple curl command:

Install requirements
This notebook obviously requires the openai and psycopg2 packages, but there are also some other additional libraries we will use. The following command installs them all:

! pip install openai psycopg2 pandas wget

Prepare your OpenAI API key
The OpenAI API key is used for vectorization of the documents and queries.

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.

Once you get your key, please add it to your environment variables as OPENAI_API_KEY.

# Test that your OpenAI API key is correctly set as an environment variable
# Note. if you run this notebook locally, you will need to reload your terminal and the notebook for the env variables to be live.
import os

# Note. alternatively you can set a temporary env variable like this:
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") is not None:
    print("OPENAI_API_KEY is ready")
else:
    print("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found")

OPENAI_API_KEY is ready
Connect to AnalyticDB
First add it to your environment variables. or you can just change the "psycopg2.connect" parameters below

Connecting to a running instance of AnalyticDB server is easy with the official Python library:

import os
import psycopg2

# Note. alternatively you can set a temporary env variable like this:
# os.environ["PGHOST"] = "your_host"
# os.environ["PGPORT"] "5432"),
# os.environ["PGDATABASE"] "postgres"),
# os.environ["PGUSER"] "user"),
# os.environ["PGPASSWORD"] "password"),

connection = psycopg2.connect(
    host=os.environ.get("PGHOST", "localhost"),
    port=os.environ.get("PGPORT", "5432"),
    database=os.environ.get("PGDATABASE", "postgres"),
    user=os.environ.get("PGUSER", "user"),
    password=os.environ.get("PGPASSWORD", "password")
)

# Create a new cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

We can test the connection by running any available method:


# Execute a simple query to test the connection
cursor.execute("SELECT 1;")
result = cursor.fetchone()

# Check the query result
if result == (1,):
    print("Connection successful!")
else:
    print("Connection failed.")

Connection successful!

The file vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.csv exists in the data directory.
Index data
AnalyticDB stores data in relation where each object is described by at least one vector. Our relation will be called articles and each object will be described by both title and content vectors. \

We will start with creating a relation and create a vector index on both title and content, and then we will fill it with our precomputed embeddings.

create_table_sql = '''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.articles (
    id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    url TEXT,
    title TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    title_vector REAL[],
    content_vector REAL[],
    vector_id INTEGER
);

ALTER TABLE public.articles ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
'''

# SQL statement for creating indexes
create_indexes_sql = '''
CREATE INDEX ON public.articles USING ann (content_vector) WITH (distancemeasure = l2, dim = '1536', pq_segments = '64', hnsw_m = '100', pq_centers = '2048');

CREATE INDEX ON public.articles USING ann (title_vector) WITH (distancemeasure = l2, dim = '1536', pq_segments = '64', hnsw_m = '100', pq_centers = '2048');
'''

# Execute the SQL statements
cursor.execute(create_table_sql)
cursor.execute(create_indexes_sql)

# Commit the changes
connection.commit()

Load data
In this section we are going to load the data prepared previous to this session, so you don't have to recompute the embeddings of Wikipedia articles with your own credits.

import io

# Path to your local CSV file
csv_file_path = '../../data/vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.csv'

# Define a generator function to process the file line by line
def process_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Replace '[' with '{' and ']' with '}'
            modified_line = line.replace('[', '{').replace(']', '}')
            yield modified_line

# Create a StringIO object to store the modified lines
modified_lines = io.StringIO(''.join(list(process_file(csv_file_path))))

# Create the COPY command for the copy_expert method
copy_command = '''
COPY public.articles (id, url, title, content, title_vector, content_vector, vector_id)
FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',');
'''

# Execute the COPY command using the copy_expert method
cursor.copy_expert(copy_command, modified_lines)

# Commit the changes
connection.commit()

# Check the collection size to make sure all the points have been stored
count_sql = """select count(*) from public.articles;"""
cursor.execute(count_sql)
result = cursor.fetchone()
print(f"Count:{result[0]}")

Count:25000
Search data
Once the data is put into Qdrant we will start querying the collection for the closest vectors. We may provide an additional parameter vector_name to switch from title to content based search. Since the precomputed embeddings were created with text-embedding-3-small OpenAI model we also have to use it during search.

def query_analyticdb(query, collection_name, vector_name="title_vector", top_k=20):

Procedure:

Prerequisites: Import libraries, set API key (if needed)
Collect: We download a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Olympics
Chunk: Documents are split into short, semi-self-contained sections to be embedded
Embed: Each section is embedded with the OpenAI API
Store: Embeddings are saved in a CSV file (for large datasets, use a vector database)
0. Prerequisites
Import libraries
# imports
import mwclient  # for downloading example Wikipedia articles
import mwparserfromhell  # for splitting Wikipedia articles into sections
import openai  # for generating embeddings
import os  # for environment variables
import pandas as pd  # for DataFrames to store article sections and embeddings
import re  # for cutting <ref> links out of Wikipedia articles
import tiktoken  # for counting tokens

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))

Install any missing libraries with pip install in your terminal. E.g.,

pip install openai

(You can also do this in a notebook cell with !pip install openai.)

If you install any libraries, be sure to restart the notebook kernel.

Set API key (if needed)
Note that the OpenAI library will try to read your API key from the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable. If you haven't already, set this environment variable by following these instructions.

1. Collect documents
In this example, we'll download a few hundred Wikipedia articles related to the 2022 Winter Olympics.

# get Wikipedia pages about the 2022 Winter Olympics

CATEGORY_TITLE = "Category:2022 Winter Olympics"
WIKI_SITE = "en.wikipedia.org"


def titles_from_category(
    category: mwclient.listing.Category, max_depth: int
) -> set[str]:
    """Return a set of page titles in a given Wiki category and its subcategories."""
    titles = set()
    for cm in category.members():
        if type(cm) == mwclient.page.Page:
            # ^type() used instead of isinstance() to catch match w/ no inheritance
            titles.add(cm.name)
        elif isinstance(cm, mwclient.listing.Category) and max_depth > 0:
            deeper_titles = titles_from_category(cm, max_depth=max_depth - 1)
            titles.update(deeper_titles)
    return titles


site = mwclient.Site(WIKI_SITE)
category_page = site.pages[CATEGORY_TITLE]
titles = titles_from_category(category_page, max_depth=1)
# ^note: max_depth=1 means we go one level deep in the category tree
print(f"Found {len(titles)} article titles in {CATEGORY_TITLE}.")

Found 731 article titles in Category:2022 Winter Olympics.
2. Chunk documents
Now that we have our reference documents, we need to prepare them for search.

Because GPT can only read a limited amount of text at once, we'll split each document into chunks short enough to be read.

For this specific example on Wikipedia articles, we'll:

Discard less relevant-looking sections like External Links and Footnotes
Clean up the text by removing reference tags (e.g., ), whitespace, and super short sections
Split each article into sections
Prepend titles and subtitles to each section's text, to help GPT understand the context
If a section is long (say, > 1,600 tokens), we'll recursively split it into smaller sections, trying to split along semantic boundaries like paragraphs
# define functions to split Wikipedia pages into sections

Next, we'll recursively split long sections into smaller sections.

There's no perfect recipe for splitting text into sections.

Some tradeoffs include:

Longer sections may be better for questions that require more context
Longer sections may be worse for retrieval, as they may have more topics muddled together
Shorter sections are better for reducing costs (which are proportional to the number of tokens)
Shorter sections allow more sections to be retrieved, which may help with recall
Overlapping sections may help prevent answers from being cut by section boundaries
Here, we'll use a simple approach and limit sections to 1,600 tokens each, recursively halving any sections that are too long. To avoid cutting in the middle of useful sentences, we'll split along paragraph boundaries when possible.

Lviv bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics

==History==

[[Image:Lwów - Rynek 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|View of Rynok Square in Lviv]]

On 27 May 2010, [[President of Ukraine]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]] stated during a visit to [[Lviv]] that Ukraine "will start working on the official nomination of our country as the holder of the Winter Olympic Games in [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]".

In September 2012, [[government of Ukraine]] approved a document about the technical-economic substantiation of the national project "Olympic Hope 2022". This was announced by Vladyslav Kaskiv, the head of Ukraine´s Derzhinvestproekt (State investment project). The organizers announced on their website venue plans featuring Lviv as the host city and location for the "ice sport" venues, [[Volovets]] (around {{convert|185|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Lviv) as venue for the [[Alpine skiing]] competitions and [[Tysovets, Skole Raion|Tysovets]] (around {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Lviv) as venue for all other "snow sport" competitions. By March 2013 no other preparations than the feasibility study had been approved.

On 24 October 2013, session of the Lviv City Council adopted a resolution "About submission to the International Olympic Committee for nomination of city to participate in the procedure for determining the host city of Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in 2022".

On 5 November 2013, it was confirmed that Lviv was bidding to host the [[2022 Winter Olympics]]. Lviv would host the ice sport events, while the skiing events would be held in the [[Carpathian]] mountains. This was the first bid Ukraine had ever submitted for an Olympic Games.

On 30 June 2014, the International Olympic Committee announced "Lviv will turn its attention to an Olympic bid for 2026, and not continue with its application for 2022. The decision comes as a result of the present political and economic circumstances in Ukraine."

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Vilkul said that the Winter Games "will be an impetus not just for promotion of sports and tourism in Ukraine, but a very important component in the economic development of Ukraine, the attraction of the investments, the creation of new jobs, opening Ukraine to the world, returning Ukrainians working abroad to their motherland."

Lviv was one of the host cities of [[UEFA Euro 2012]].
3. Embed document chunks
Now that we've split our library into shorter self-contained strings, we can compute embeddings for each.

(For large embedding jobs, use a script like api_request_parallel_processor.py to parallelize requests while throttling to stay under rate limits.)

EMBEDDING_MODEL = "text-embedding-3-small"
BATCH_SIZE = 1000  # you can submit up to 2048 embedding inputs per request

embeddings = []
for batch_start in range(0, len(wikipedia_strings), BATCH_SIZE):
    batch_end = batch_start + BATCH_SIZE
    batch = wikipedia_strings[batch_start:batch_end]
    print(f"Batch {batch_start} to {batch_end-1}")
    response = client.embeddings.create(model=EMBEDDING_MODEL, input=batch)
    for i, be in enumerate(response.data):
        assert i == be.index  # double check embeddings are in same order as input
    batch_embeddings = [e.embedding for e in response.data]
    embeddings.extend(batch_embeddings)

df = pd.DataFrame({"text": wikipedia_strings, "embedding": embeddings})

Batch 0 to 999
Batch 1000 to 1999
Batch 2000 to 2999
Batch 3000 to 3999
Batch 4000 to 4999
Batch 5000 to 5999
Batch 6000 to 6999
4. Store document chunks and embeddings
Because this example only uses a few thousand strings, we'll store them in a CSV file.

(For larger datasets, use a vector database, which will be more performant.)

# save document chunks and embeddings

SAVE_PATH = "data/winter_olympics_2022.csv"

df.to_csv(SAVE_PATH, index=False)
What is Langchain?
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. Their framework enables you to build layered LLM-powered applications that are context-aware and able to interact dynamically with their environment as agents, leading to simplified code for you and a more dynamic user experience for your customers.

Why do LLMs need to use Tools?
One of the most common challenges with LLMs is overcoming the lack of recency and specificity in their training data - answers can be out of date, and they are prone to hallucinations given the huge variety in their knowledge base. Tools are a great method of allowing an LLM to answer within a controlled context that draws on your existing knowledge bases and internal APIs - instead of trying to prompt engineer the LLM all the way to your intended answer, you allow it access to tools that it calls on dynamically for info, parses, and serves to customer.

Providing LLMs access to tools can enable them to answer questions with context directly from search engines, APIs or your own databases. Instead of answering directly, an LLM with access to tools can perform intermediate steps to gather relevant information. Tools can also be used in combination. For example, a language model can be made to use a search tool to lookup quantitative information and a calculator to execute calculations.

Notebook Sections
Setup: Import packages and connect to a Pinecone vector database.
LLM Agent: Build an agent that leverages a modified version of the ReAct framework to do chain-of-thought reasoning.
LLM Agent with History: Provide the LLM with access to previous steps in the conversation.
Knowledge Base: Create a knowledge base of "Stuff You Should Know" podcast episodes, to be accessed through a tool.
LLM Agent with Tools: Extend the agent with access to multiple tools and test that it uses them to answer questions.

Setup
Import libraries and set up a connection to a Pinecone vector database.

You can substitute Pinecone for any other vectorstore or database - there are a selection that are supported by Langchain natively, while other connectors will need to be developed yourself.

index_name = 'podcasts'

For acquiring an API key to connect with Pinecone, you can set up a free account and store it in the api_key variable below or in your environment variables under PINECONE_API_KEY

api_key = os.getenv("PINECONE_API_KEY") or "PINECONE_API_KEY"

# find environment next to your API key in the Pinecone console
env = os.getenv("PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT") or "PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT"

pinecone.init(api_key=api_key, environment=env)
pinecone.whoami()

pinecone.list_indexes()

['podcasts']
Run this code block if you want to clear the index, or if the index doesn't exist yet

# Check whether the index with the same name already exists - if so, delete it
if index_name in pinecone.list_indexes():
    pinecone.delete_index(index_name)
    
# Creates new index
pinecone.create_index(name=index_name, dimension=1536)
index = pinecone.Index(index_name=index_name)
# Confirm our index was created
pinecone.list_indexes()

LLM Agent
An LLM agent in Langchain has many configurable components, which are detailed in the Langchain documentation.

We'll employ a few of the core concepts to make an agent that talks in the way we want, can use tools to answer questions, and uses the appropriate language model to power the conversation.

Prompt Template: The input template to control the LLM's behaviour and how it accepts inputs and produces outputs - this is the brain that drives your application (docs).
Output Parser: A method of parsing the output from the prompt. If the LLM produces output using certain headers, you can enable complex interactions where variables are generated by the LLM in their response and passed into the next step of the chain (docs).
LLM Chain: A Chain brings together a prompt template with an LLM that will execute it - in this case we'll be using gpt-3.5-turbo but this framework can be used with OpenAI completions models, or other LLMs entirely (docs).
Tool: An external service that the LLM can use to retrieve information or execute commands should the user require it (docs).
Agent: The glue that brings all of this together, an agent can call multiple LLM Chains, each with their own tools. Agents can be extended with your own logic to allow retries, error handling and any other methods you choose to add reliability to your application (docs).
NB: Before using this cookbook with the Search tool you'll need to sign up on https://serpapi.com/ and generate an API key. Once you have it, store it in an environment variable named SERPAPI_API_KEY

# Initiate a Search tool - note you'll need to have set SERPAPI_API_KEY as an environment variable as per the above instructions
search = SerpAPIWrapper()

# Define a list of tools

Knowledge base
Create a custom vectorstore for the Agent to use as a tool to answer questions with. We'll store the results in Pinecone, which is supported by LangChain (Docs, API reference). For help getting started with Pinecone or other vector databases, we have a cookbook to help you get started.

You can check the LangChain documentation to see what other vectorstores and databases are available.

For this example we'll use the transcripts of the Stuff You Should Know podcast, which was provided thanks to OSF DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/VM9NT

Title: sysk: Can You Live Without a Bank Account?

Title: sysk_with_transcripts_Can you live without a bank account.json;  And if you had a life, you didn't necessarily rectify your bank checkbook every day. Oh, wait, what is balancing a checkbook mean? Seriously? Yeah. Thank God for my wife. So another reason you might avoid a bank is philosophically. There may be a longstanding distrust of banks in your family that you don't want to put your money in, or you may just want to be like, you know what? I don't want to take part in this modern society. I want to kind of drop out a bit. And a really good first move is to shut your bank account down. That's a big statement. Oh, yeah, it is. But a lot of people that are underbanked and don't have accounts aren't there on purpose. It's not some philosophical statement. A lot of times it's simply because they are poor and they don't have a lot of alternatives. Yeah. And the other thing about not having a bank account, not only do you not have a bank account, you also are, like, basically just avoiding banks altogether. There's plenty of other things that banks offer, like loans and mortgage, lollipops, stuff like that. Yeah. Maybe some free nasty coffee. So when you don't have a banking account, that's like the most basic unit of the banking world. Right. If you don't have that, you obviously aren't going to be exposed to all these other things that can help. Things like build your credit history through like a revolving loan or a mortgage or a car loan or something like that that you can build up your credit for and ultimately save money. So when you don't have a bank account, for whatever reason, you are effectively out of the banking system. The problem is you can live parallel to the banking system outside of it, but it can be really dangerous, especially if you're just dealing with cash, because that cash has to stay somewhere, whether it's on you or in your mattress or in a coffee can in your backyard. You're exposed for having that readily available to anybody who finds it or comes into your house with a gun to get it. Yes.


Title: sysk: Can You Live Without a Bank Account?

Title: sysk_with_transcripts_Can you live without a bank account.json;  And it doesn't have to be an everyday thing. You can host when you want. Like, let's say you're taking a week's vacation.

Explore the possibilities at CapitalOne. comCOMMERCIAL all right, so if you live in modern society today, it is pretty tough to get by without a bank. Most cases these days you have well, I don't know about most cases, but in many cases you have automatic deposits of your work checks. Sure. A lot of people pay their bills wirelessly, online, directly from their bank. You might have a student loan, you might have a car loan, you might have your house mortgage, you might pay your credit card bills. All this stuff is running through a bank, most likely. And you would think it's probably impossible to not have a bank account these days. And I would say pretty much all Americans have them. Not true. Well, pretty much all Americans do. Like 93% do. Yeah, but that's not all. No, it's true.


Title: sysk: Can You Live Without a Bank Account?

Title: sysk_with_transcripts_Can you live without a bank account.json;  Yeah. 7% of Americans do not have bank accounts. About 9 million people last year in 2015 did not have bank accounts. 9 million people is a lot of people. No, it really is. And apparently that's household sorry, not people. Yeah, right. You're that is a big distinction, too. And the FDIC said, man, that's the lowest since we've been tracking this by far. And someone said, well, how long have you been tracking this? They said, well, the last six years. Really? Yeah, which I'm like. Really? That's when they started tracking it, but apparently so 2009. So if you want another number, the 9 million American households don't have bank accounts at all, then there are 25 million households in addition to that. So that makes almost like 34 million households, which that's a substantial number at this point. Sure. The 25 million are what's called underbanked, meaning they may have a bank account, but they don't use the bank account. Yeah. They don't use it because they are probably afraid of overdraft fees. Or they have maybe a bank account that got grandfathered in so that they don't have to pay minimum amount fees. And who knows? There's all sorts of reasons for people to not use a bank account that they have, but probably cheap among them is overdressed, which you'll talk more about. Yeah. And the majority of these underbank people in the United States are poor, usually. A lot of times they're minorities, a lot of times they're less educated. And these communities, there's a few reasons why they may not want to use a bank one. Maybe they don't trust banks. And if you look in the history of the United States or certainly even we're just talking about the Wells Fargo scandal, when you see stuff like that on the news, it should be upsetting to everyone. But obviously if you're poor and you don't have a lot of money, that may scare you into not wanting to use a bank at all. Right? Yeah.


Title: sysk: Can You Live Without a Bank Account?

Title: sysk_with_transcripts_Can you live without a bank account.json;  Maybe at the time, I might be making it up. I seem to remember them saying that, and I was like, I don't want that. Just let the check bounce and I'll take it up with them. Yes. The way it was marketed, though, was like, hey, we value you. We want to make sure that you can pay all your bills. So if something happens and you're overdrafted we'll cover it. We're just going to charge you a fee. And it sounds good, but again, when you go from high to low and all of a sudden your overdraft fees go from one to four or five or however many, that's a huge problem. Well, and the people that are overdrafting and the people that are at least able to afford those fees. Exactly. So it's a disproportionate burden on the poor, which makes it, as a scam, one of the more evil scams around. Yes. It's just wrong, then the idea that if you open an account, you should not opt in for overdraft protection. And it's easy to say when you're talking about checks for, like you're writing a check for a Mountain Dew and some cheetos. Yeah, who cares if you're short for that? You can go without that. But when you're talking about your rent check or like an actual grocery bill or something like that, it sucks that you can't get that stuff. But it's better to have to put a couple of things back than to pay $35 for one $2 item that you went over by, right? Yeah, that's a good point. And this was in my case, too. This is also back in the day when you I mean, a lot of times it was a mystery how much you had in your account. Right. Like, you couldn't just get on your phone before you write the check and be like, oh, well, no, I don't have enough money to cover this. Yeah, because even if you balanced your checkbook, sometimes you forgot to carry the one, it wasn't always 100% accurate.

Japan's economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show.

Revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.
The government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. "I maintain the view that Japan's economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully," said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. "It's painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought," said Paul Sheard, economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand, with private consumption up just 0.2% in the third quarter.

text_3 = """Google's toolbar sparks concern

Search engine firm Google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites.

The AutoLink feature comes with Google's latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to Amazon.com if it finds a book's ISBN number on the site. It also links to Google's map service, if there is an address, or to car firm Carfax, if there is a licence plate. Google said the feature, available only in the US, "adds useful links". But some users are concerned that Google's dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like Amazon.

AutoLink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage - even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission.

If a user clicks the AutoLink feature in the Google toolbar then a webpage with a book's unique ISBN number would link directly to Amazon's website. It could mean online libraries that list ISBN book numbers find they are directing users to Amazon.com whether they like it or not. Websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services. Dan Gillmor, founder of Grassroots Media, which supports citizen-based media, said the tool was a "bad idea, and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth". In a statement Google said the feature was still only in beta, ie trial, stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users. It said: "The user can choose never to click on the AutoLink button, and web pages she views will never be modified. "In addition, the user can choose to disable the AutoLink feature entirely at any time."

The new tool has been compared to the Smart Tags feature from Microsoft by some users. It was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by Microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised. Smart Tags allowed Microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company. Google said none of the companies which received AutoLinks had paid for the service. Some users said AutoLink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any "click through" to a commercial site. Cory Doctorow, European outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group Electronic Fronter Foundation, said that Google should not be penalised for its market dominance. "Of course Google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses. "But as an end user I would want to know - 'Can I choose to use this service?, 'How much is Google being paid?', 'Can I substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by Google?'." Mr Doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using AutoLink or "tricked into using the service".

Paula Radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the World Cross-Country Championships.

The 31-year-old is concerned the event, which starts on 19 March in France, could upset her preparations for the London Marathon on 17 April. "There is no question that Paula would be a huge asset to the GB team," said Zara Hyde Peters of UK Athletics. "But she is working out whether she can accommodate the worlds without too much compromise in her marathon training." Radcliffe must make a decision by Tuesday - the deadline for team nominations. British team member Hayley Yelling said the team would understand if Radcliffe opted out of the event. "It would be fantastic to have Paula in the team," said the European cross-country champion. "But you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus. "She is not messing us around. We all understand the problem." Radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year's event because of injury. In her absence, the GB team won bronze in Brussels.

Ethiopia's Tirunesh Dibaba set a new world record in winning the women's 5,000m at the Boston Indoor Games.

Dibaba won in 14 minutes 32.93 seconds to erase the previous world indoor mark of 14:39.29 set by another Ethiopian, Berhane Adera, in Stuttgart last year. But compatriot Kenenisa Bekele's record hopes were dashed when he miscounted his laps in the men's 3,000m and staged his sprint finish a lap too soon. Ireland's Alistair Cragg won in 7:39.89 as Bekele battled to second in 7:41.42. "I didn't want to sit back and get out-kicked," said Cragg. "So I kept on the pace. The plan was to go with 500m to go no matter what, but when Bekele made the mistake that was it. The race was mine." Sweden's Carolina Kluft, the Olympic heptathlon champion, and Slovenia's Jolanda Ceplak had winning performances, too. Kluft took the long jump at 6.63m, while Ceplak easily won the women's 800m in 2:01.52. 


distance:0.268 content:Japan narrowly escapes recession

Japan's economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show.

Revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.
The government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. "I maintain the view that Japan's economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully," said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. "It's painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought," said Paul Sheard, economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand, with private consumption up just 0.2% in the third quarter.


distance:0.287 content:Google's toolbar sparks concern

Search engine firm Google has released a trial tool which is concerning some net users because it directs people to pre-selected commercial websites.

The AutoLink feature comes with Google's latest toolbar and provides links in a webpage to Amazon.com if it finds a book's ISBN number on the site. It also links to Google's map service, if there is an address, or to car firm Carfax, if there is a licence plate. Google said the feature, available only in the US, "adds useful links". But some users are concerned that Google's dominant position in the search engine market place could mean it would be giving a competitive edge to firms like Amazon.

AutoLink works by creating a link to a website based on information contained in a webpage - even if there is no link specified and whether or not the publisher of the page has given permission.

If a user clicks the AutoLink feature in the Google toolbar then a webpage with a book's unique ISBN number would link directly to Amazon's website. It could mean online libraries that list ISBN book numbers find they are directing users to Amazon.com whether they like it or not. Websites which have paid for advertising on their pages may also be directing people to rival services. Dan Gillmor, founder of Grassroots Media, which supports citizen-based media, said the tool was a "bad idea, and an unfortunate move by a company that is looking to continue its hypergrowth". In a statement Google said the feature was still only in beta, ie trial, stage and that the company welcomed feedback from users. It said: "The user can choose never to click on the AutoLink button, and web pages she views will never be modified. "In addition, the user can choose to disable the AutoLink feature entirely at any time."

The new tool has been compared to the Smart Tags feature from Microsoft by some users. It was widely criticised by net users and later dropped by Microsoft after concerns over trademark use were raised. Smart Tags allowed Microsoft to link any word on a web page to another site chosen by the company. Google said none of the companies which received AutoLinks had paid for the service. Some users said AutoLink would only be fair if websites had to sign up to allow the feature to work on their pages or if they received revenue for any "click through" to a commercial site. Cory Doctorow, European outreach coordinator for digital civil liberties group Electronic Fronter Foundation, said that Google should not be penalised for its market dominance. "Of course Google should be allowed to direct people to whatever proxies it chooses. "But as an end user I would want to know - 'Can I choose to use this service?, 'How much is Google being paid?', 'Can I substitute my own companies for the ones chosen by Google?'." Mr Doctorow said the only objection would be if users were forced into using AutoLink or "tricked into using the service".

Ethiopia produced 14.27 million tonnes of crops in 2004, 24% higher than in 2003 and 21% more than the average of the past five years, a report says.

In 2003, crop production totalled 11.49 million tonnes, the joint report from the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme said. Good rains, increased use of fertilizers and improved seeds contributed to the rise in production. Nevertheless, 2.2 million Ethiopians will still need emergency assistance.

The report calculated emergency food requirements for 2005 to be 387,500 tonnes. On top of that, 89,000 tonnes of fortified blended food and vegetable oil for "targeted supplementary food distributions for a survival programme for children under five and pregnant and lactating women" will be needed.

In eastern and southern Ethiopia, a prolonged drought has killed crops and drained wells. Last year, a total of 965,000 tonnes of food assistance was needed to help seven million Ethiopians. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recommend that the food assistance is bought locally. "Local purchase of cereals for food assistance programmes is recommended as far as possible, so as to assist domestic markets and farmers," said Henri Josserand, chief of FAO's Global Information and Early Warning System. Agriculture is the main economic activity in Ethiopia, representing 45% of gross domestic product. About 80% of Ethiopians depend directly or indirectly on agriculture.

Open in Github
This notebook demonstrates how to use Redis as high-speed context memory with ChatGPT.

Prerequisites
Redis instance with the Redis Search and Redis JSON modules
Redis-py client lib
OpenAI Python client lib
OpenAI API key
Installation
Install Python modules necessary for the examples.

! pip install redis openai python-dotenv openai[datalib]

OpenAI API Key
Create a .env file and add your OpenAI key to it

OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key

OpenAI Setup
Key load + helper function for chat completion

import openai
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, 
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]

Experiment - Chat Completion on a Topic outside of the Model's Knowledge Cutoff Date
Gpt-3.5-turbo was trained on data up to Sep 2021. Let's ask it a question about something that is beyond that date. In this case, the FTX/Sam Bankman-Fried scandal.

prompt = "Is Sam Bankman-Fried's company, FTX, considered a well-managed company?"
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)

Incomplete Information
An unfortunate behavior of these AI systems is the system will provide a confident-sounding response - even when the system is not confident with its result. One way to mitigate this is prompt re-engineering, as seen below.

prompt ="Is Sam Bankman-Fried's company, FTX, considered a well-managed company?  If you don't know for certain, say unknown."
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)

Additional Context
Another way to combat incomplete information is to give the system more information such that it can make intelligent decisions vs guessing. We'll use Redis as the source for that additional context. We'll pull in business news articles from after the GPT knowledge cut-off date such that the system will have a better understanding of how FTX was actually managed.

Embattled Crypto Exchange FTX Files for Bankruptcy

Nov. 11, 2022
On Monday, Sam Bankman-Fried, the chief executive of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, took to Twitter to reassure his customers: “FTX is fine,” he wrote. “Assets are fine.”

On Friday, FTX announced that it was filing for bankruptcy, capping an extraordinary week of corporate drama that has upended crypto markets, sent shock waves through an industry struggling to gain mainstream credibility and sparked government investigations that could lead to more damaging revelations or even criminal charges.

In a statement on Twitter, the company said that Mr. Bankman-Fried had resigned, with John J. Ray III, a corporate turnaround specialist, taking over as chief executive.

The speed of FTX’s downfall has left crypto insiders stunned. Just days ago, Mr. Bankman-Fried was considered one of the smartest leaders in the crypto industry, an influential figure in Washington who was lobbying to shape regulations. And FTX was widely viewed as one of the most stable and responsible companies in the freewheeling, loosely regulated crypto industry.

“Here we are, with one of the richest people in the world, his net worth dropping to zero, his business dropping to zero,” said Jared Ellias, a bankruptcy professor at Harvard Law School. “The velocity of this failure is just unbelievable.”

Now, the bankruptcy has set up a rush among investors and customers to salvage funds from what remains of FTX. A surge of customers tried to withdraw funds from the platform this week, and the company couldn’t meet the demand. The exchange owes as much as $8 billion, according to people familiar with its finances.

FTX’s collapse has destabilized the crypto industry, which was already reeling from a crash in the spring that drained $1 trillion from the market. The prices of the leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether, have plummeted. The crypto lender BlockFi, which was closely entangled with FTX, announced on Thursday that it was suspending operations as a result of FTX’s collapse.

Mr. Bankman-Fried was backed by some of the highest-profile venture capital investors in Silicon Valley, including Sequoia Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Some of those investors, facing questions about how closely they scrutinized FTX before they put money into it, have said that their nine-figure investments in the crypto exchange are now essentially worthless.

The company’s demise has also set off a reckoning over risky practices that have become pervasive in crypto, an industry that was founded partly as a corrective to the type of dangerous financial engineering that caused the 2008 economic crisis.

“I’m really sorry, again, that we ended up here,” Mr. Bankman-Fried said on Twitter on Friday. “Hopefully this can bring some amount of transparency, trust, and governance.”

The bankruptcy filing marks the start of what will probably be months or even years of legal fallout, as lawyers try to work out whether the exchange can ever continue to operate in some form and customers demand compensation. FTX is already the target of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, with investigators focused on whether the company improperly used customer funds to prop up Alameda Research, a trading firm that Mr. Bankman-Fried also founded.

The bankruptcy filing included FTX, its U.S. arm and Alameda. According to a bare-bones legal filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, FTX has assets valued between $10 billion and $50 billion, with the size of its liabilities in the same range. The company has more than 100,000 creditors, the filing said.

The bankruptcy is a stunning fall from grace for the 30-year-old Mr. Bankman-Fried, who cultivated a reputation as a boy genius with a host of endearing quirks, including a habit of sleeping on a beanbag at the office. At one point, he was one of the richest people in the industry, with an estimated fortune of $24 billion. He hobnobbed with actors, professional athletes and former world leaders.

Mr. Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire had an elaborate structure. The bankruptcy filing lists more than 130 corporate entities affiliated with FTX and Alameda. But as of June, FTX had only about 300 employees, a point of pride for Mr. Bankman-Fried, who said he had resisted calls from venture investors to hire more staff.

“We told them additional employees added too quickly were net negative,” Mr. Bankman-Fried said on Twitter in June. “They could take it or leave it.”

Unusually for a major start-up, none of FTX’s investors had seats on the board, which instead consisted of Mr. Bankman-Fried, another FTX executive and a lawyer in Antigua and Barbuda.

FTX and Alameda were based in the Bahamas, where Mr. Bankman-Fried and a small circle of top executives called most of the shots and lived together in a luxury resort. Officially, Alameda was run by Caroline Ellison, a former trader for the hedge fund Jane Street, but Mr. Bankman-Fried was heavily involved, contributing to the decision-making on big trades, according to a person familiar with the matter.

In addition to Mr. Bankman-Fried and Ms. Ellison, the circle of executives running FTX included Nishad Singh, FTX’s director of engineering, and Gary Wang, the chief technology officer. Few others had visibility into how the company was run: When the firm collapsed this week, lower-ranking employees were left confused and blindsided, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Singh and Ms. Ellison did not respond to requests for comment; Mr. Wang could not immediately be reached.

As a crypto exchange, FTX provided a marketplace for customers to buy, sell and store a wide range of digital currencies. Most of its revenue stemmed from a risky type of trade — in which crypto investors borrowed money to make huge bets on the future prices of cryptocurrencies — that remains illegal in the United States. But Mr. Bankman-Fried also ran a smaller U.S. affiliate that offered more basic trading options.

Mr. Bankman-Fried’s problems started over the weekend, when the chief executive of Binance, the largest crypto exchange, suggested publicly that FTX might be on shaky financial footing. A rush of customers tried to withdraw their crypto holdings from the platform, and FTX was unable to meet the demand.

On Tuesday, Mr. Bankman-Fried said he had struck a deal to sell FTX to Binance. But after reviewing the company’s financial documents, Binance’s chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, pulled out of the agreement, leaving Mr. Bankman-Fried with limited options.

In calls with investors and messages to employees this week, he apologized repeatedly and stressed that he was working hard to raise money and resolve the situation. But the hole was ultimately too big to fill.

FTX’s bankruptcy is the latest — and by far the biggest — in a series of bankruptcies that have shaken the crypto world this year. After a market crash in the spring, two crypto lending companies, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, filed for bankruptcy, kicking off months of legal maneuvering over how their remaining assets should be divided. In an ironic twist, FTX had recently won an auction to buy Voyager’s remaining assets.

As it enters its own bankruptcy process, FTX will be led by Mr. Ray, who has ample experience managing distressed situations. He helped manage Enron after the collapse of its business in an accounting fraud scandal in 2001. And he helped liquidate the trust of the subprime mortgage company ResCap after its 2012 bankruptcy.

The bankruptcy proceedings may be only the beginning of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s legal troubles. Federal investigators are examining the relationship between FTX and Alameda, and customers are likely to file lawsuits.

Mr. Bankman-Fried’s old allies have quickly abandoned him. On Thursday night, the team running the FTX Future Fund, a charitable group that Mr. Bankman-Fried bankrolled, announced that they were resigning.

“We were shocked and immensely saddened to learn of the recent events at FTX,” they wrote in a statement. “We have fundamental questions about the legitimacy and integrity of the business operations that were funding the FTX Foundation and the Future Fund.”

Not long ago, Mr. Bankman-Fried was performing a comedy routine onstage at a conference with Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House communications director and a business partner of FTX.

“I’m disappointed,” Mr. Scaramucci said in an interview on CNBC on Friday. “Duped, I guess, is the right word.”

Repeat the Question to OpenAI with context
Now that we have relevant context, add that to the prompt to OpenAI and get a very different response.

No, Sam Bankman-Fried's company FTX is not considered a well-managed company as it has filed for bankruptcy and owes as much as $8 billion to its creditors. The collapse of FTX has destabilized the crypto industry, and the company is already the target of investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department. FTX was widely viewed as one of the most stable and responsible companies in the freewheeling, loosely regulated crypto industry, but its risky practices have become pervasive in crypto, leading to a reckoning.
This notebook guides you step by step on using Hologres as a vector database for OpenAI embeddings.

This notebook presents an end-to-end process of:

Using precomputed embeddings created by OpenAI API.
Storing the embeddings in a cloud instance of Hologres.
Converting raw text query to an embedding with OpenAI API.
Using Hologres to perform the nearest neighbour search in the created collection.
Provide large language models with the search results as context in prompt engineering
What is Hologres
Hologres is a unified real-time data warehousing service developed by Alibaba Cloud. You can use Hologres to write, update, process, and analyze large amounts of data in real time. Hologres supports standard SQL syntax, is compatible with PostgreSQL, and supports most PostgreSQL functions. Hologres supports online analytical processing (OLAP) and ad hoc analysis for up to petabytes of data, and provides high-concurrency and low-latency online data services. Hologres supports fine-grained isolation of multiple workloads and enterprise-level security capabilities. Hologres is deeply integrated with MaxCompute, Realtime Compute for Apache Flink, and DataWorks, and provides full-stack online and offline data warehousing solutions for enterprises.

Hologres provides vector database functionality by adopting Proxima.

Proxima is a high-performance software library developed by Alibaba DAMO Academy. It allows you to search for the nearest neighbors of vectors. Proxima provides higher stability and performance than similar open source software such as Facebook AI Similarity Search (Faiss). Proxima provides basic modules that have leading performance and effects in the industry and allows you to search for similar images, videos, or human faces. Hologres is deeply integrated with Proxima to provide a high-performance vector search service.

Deployment options
Click here to fast deploy Hologres data warehouse.
Prerequisites
For the purposes of this exercise we need to prepare a couple of things:

Hologres cloud server instance.
The 'psycopg2-binary' library to interact with the vector database. Any other postgresql client library is ok.
An OpenAI API key.
We might validate if the server was launched successfully by running a simple curl command:

Install requirements
This notebook obviously requires the openai and psycopg2-binary packages, but there are also some other additional libraries we will use. The following command installs them all:

! pip install openai psycopg2-binary pandas wget

Prepare your OpenAI API key
The OpenAI API key is used for vectorization of the documents and queries.

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.

Once you get your key, please add it to your environment variables as OPENAI_API_KEY.

# Test that your OpenAI API key is correctly set as an environment variable
# Note. if you run this notebook locally, you will need to reload your terminal and the notebook for the env variables to be live.
import os

# Note. alternatively you can set a temporary env variable like this:
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") is not None:
    print("OPENAI_API_KEY is ready")
else:
    print("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found")

OPENAI_API_KEY is ready
Connect to Hologres
First add it to your environment variables. or you can just change the "psycopg2.connect" parameters below

Connecting to a running instance of Hologres server is easy with the official Python library:

import os
import psycopg2

# Note. alternatively you can set a temporary env variable like this:
# os.environ["PGHOST"] = "your_host"
# os.environ["PGPORT"] "5432"),
# os.environ["PGDATABASE"] "postgres"),
# os.environ["PGUSER"] "user"),
# os.environ["PGPASSWORD"] "password"),

connection = psycopg2.connect(
    host=os.environ.get("PGHOST", "localhost"),
    port=os.environ.get("PGPORT", "5432"),
    database=os.environ.get("PGDATABASE", "postgres"),
    user=os.environ.get("PGUSER", "user"),
    password=os.environ.get("PGPASSWORD", "password")
)
connection.set_session(autocommit=True)

# Create a new cursor object
cursor = connection.cursor()

We can test the connection by running any available method:


# Execute a simple query to test the connection
cursor.execute("SELECT 1;")
result = cursor.fetchone()

# Check the query result
if result == (1,):
    print("Connection successful!")
else:
    print("Connection failed.")

Connection successful!
import wget

embeddings_url = "https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.zip"

# The file is ~700 MB so this will take some time
wget.download(embeddings_url)

The downloaded file has to be then extracted:

import zipfile
import os
import re
import tempfile

current_directory = os.getcwd()
zip_file_path = os.path.join(current_directory, "vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.zip")
output_directory = os.path.join(current_directory, "../../data")

with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, "r") as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall(output_directory)


# check the csv file exist
file_name = "vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.csv"
data_directory = os.path.join(current_directory, "../../data")
file_path = os.path.join(data_directory, file_name)


if os.path.exists(file_path):
    print(f"The file {file_name} exists in the data directory.")
else:
    print(f"The file {file_name} does not exist in the data directory.")

The file vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.csv exists in the data directory.
Load data
In this section we are going to load the data prepared previous to this session, so you don't have to recompute the embeddings of Wikipedia articles with your own credits.

Create table and proxima vector index
Hologres stores data in tables where each object is described by at least one vector. Our table will be called articles and each object will be described by both title and content vectors.

We will start with creating a table and create proxima indexes on both title and content, and then we will fill it with our precomputed embeddings.

cursor.execute('CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS proxima;')
create_proxima_table_sql = '''

    }'
);  

COMMIT;
'''

# Execute the SQL statements (will autocommit)
cursor.execute(create_proxima_table_sql)

Upload data
Now let's upload the data to the Hologres cloud instance using COPY statement. This might take 5-10 minutes according to the network bandwidth.

import io

# Path to the unzipped CSV file
csv_file_path = '../../data/vector_database_wikipedia_articles_embedded.csv'

# In SQL, arrays are surrounded by {}, rather than []
def process_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Replace '[' with '{' and ']' with '}'
            modified_line = line.replace('[', '{').replace(']', '}')
            yield modified_line

# Create a StringIO object to store the modified lines
modified_lines = io.StringIO(''.join(list(process_file(csv_file_path))))

# Create the COPY command for the copy_expert method
copy_command = '''
COPY public.articles (id, url, title, content, title_vector, content_vector, vector_id)
FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',');
'''

# Execute the COPY command using the copy_expert method
cursor.copy_expert(copy_command, modified_lines)

The proxima index will be built in the background. We can do searching during this period but the query will be slow without the vector index. Use this command to wait for finish building the index.

cursor.execute('vacuum articles;')

# Check the collection size to make sure all the points have been stored
count_sql = "select count(*) from articles;"
cursor.execute(count_sql)
result = cursor.fetchone()
print(f"Count:{result[0]}")

Count:25000
Search data
Once the data is uploaded we will start querying the collection for the closest vectors. We may provide an additional parameter vector_name to switch from title to content based search. Since the precomputed embeddings were created with text-embedding-3-small OpenAI model we also have to use it during search.

import openai
def query_knn(query, table_name, vector_name="title_vector", top_k=20):

    # Creates embedding vector from user query
    embedded_query = openai.Embedding.create(

How to create dynamic masks with DALL·E and Segment Anything

OpenAI Logo
Colin Jarvis
May 18, 2023
Open in Github
Segment Anything is a model from Meta that can be used to select portions of images. Combined with DALL·E's ability to inpaint specified portions of images, you can use Segment Anything to easily select any part of an image you'd like to alter.

In this notebook, we'll use these tools to become fashion designers and dynamically replace our digital models' outfits with tailored, original creations. The notebook follows this flow:

Setup: Initialise your libraries and any location directories.
Generate original image: Make an original image that we'll create dynamic masks from.
Generate mask: Use Segment Anything to create a dynamic mask.
Create new image: Generate a new image with the masked area inpainted with a fresh prompt.
Setup
To get started we'll need to follow the instructions for using the Segment Anything (SAM) model open-sourced by Meta. As of May 2023, the key steps are:

Install Pytorch (version 1.7+).
Install the library using pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git.
Install dependencies using pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx.
Download a model checkpoint to use (default size is 2.4 GB).
!pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
!pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
!pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx
!pip install requests
!pip install openai
!pip install numpy

!wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth

import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
from matplotlib import rcParams
import numpy as np
from openai import OpenAI
import os
from PIL import Image
import requests
from segment_anything import sam_model_registry, SamAutomaticMaskGenerator, SamPredictor
import torch

# Set directories for generation images and edit images
base_image_dir = os.path.join("images", "01_generations")
mask_dir = os.path.join("images", "02_masks")
edit_image_dir = os.path.join("images", "03_edits")

# Point to your downloaded SAM model
sam_model_filepath = "./sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth"

# Initiate SAM model
sam = sam_model_registry["default"](checkpoint=sam_model_filepath)

# Initiate openAI client
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))

Generate original image
First we'll create an original image which we'll generate masks from.

def process_dalle_images(response, filename, image_dir):
    # save the images
    urls = [datum.url for datum in response.data]  # extract URLs
    images = [requests.get(url).content for url in urls]  # download images
    image_names = [f"{filename}_{i + 1}.png" for i in range(len(images))]  # create names
    filepaths = [os.path.join(image_dir, name) for name in image_names]  # create filepaths
    for image, filepath in zip(images, filepaths):  # loop through the variations
        with open(filepath, "wb") as image_file:  # open the file
            image_file.write(image)  # write the image to the file

    return filepaths

dalle_prompt = '''
Full length, zoomed out photo of our premium Lederhosen-inspired jumpsuit.
Showcase the intricate hand-stitched details and high-quality leather, while highlighting the perfect blend of Austrian heritage and modern fashion.
This piece appeals to a sophisticated, trendsetting audience who appreciates cultural fusion and innovative design.
'''

# Generate your images
generation_response = client.images.generate(
    model = "dall-e-3",
    prompt=dalle_prompt,
    n=3,
    size="1024x1024",
    response_format="url",
)

filepaths = process_dalle_images(generation_response, "generation", base_image_dir)

# print the new generations
for filepath in filepaths:
    print(filepath)
    display(Image.open(filepath))

Generate Mask
Next we'll load up one of our images and generate masks.

For this demonstration we're picking a UX where we "click" on a point on the image to generate masks from. However, there are example notebooks provided by Meta which show how to generate every possible mask for an image, draw a box, and some other useful approaches.

# Pick one of your generated images
chosen_image = "images/01_generations/generation_2.png"

# Function to display mask using matplotlib
def show_mask(mask, ax):
    color = np.array([30 / 255, 144 / 255, 255 / 255, 0.6])
    h, w = mask.shape[-2:]
    mask_image = mask.reshape(h, w, 1) * color.reshape(1, 1, -1)
    ax.imshow(mask_image)


# Function to display where we've "clicked"
def show_points(coords, labels, ax, marker_size=375):
    pos_points = coords[labels == 1]
    neg_points = coords[labels == 0]
    ax.scatter(
        pos_points[:, 0],
        pos_points[:, 1],
        color="green",
        marker="*",
        s=marker_size,
        edgecolor="white",
        linewidth=1.25,
    )
    ax.scatter(
        neg_points[:, 0],
        neg_points[:, 1],
        color="red",
        marker="*",
        s=marker_size,
        edgecolor="white",
        linewidth=1.25,
    )

# Load chosen image using opencv
image = cv2.imread(chosen_image)
image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# Display our chosen image
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis("on")
plt.show()

image generated by notebook
# Set the pixel coordinates for our "click" to assign masks
input_point = np.array([[525, 325]])
input_label = np.array([1])

# Display the point we've clicked on
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.imshow(image)
show_points(input_point, input_label, plt.gca())
plt.axis("on")
plt.show()

image generated by notebook
# Initiate predictor with Segment Anything model
predictor = SamPredictor(sam)
predictor.set_image(image)

# Use the predictor to gather masks for the point we clicked
masks, scores, logits = predictor.predict(
    point_coords=input_point,
    point_labels=input_label,
    multimask_output=True,
)

# Check the shape - should be three masks of the same dimensions as our image
masks.shape

(3, 1024, 1024)
# Display the possible masks we can select along with their confidence
for i, (mask, score) in enumerate(zip(masks, scores)):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
    plt.imshow(image)
    show_mask(mask, plt.gca())
    show_points(input_point, input_label, plt.gca())
    plt.title(f"Mask {i+1}, Score: {score:.3f}", fontsize=18)
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.show()

image generated by notebookimage generated by notebookimage generated by notebook
# Choose which mask you'd like to use
chosen_mask = masks[1]

# We'll now reverse the mask so that it is clear and everything else is white
chosen_mask = chosen_mask.astype("uint8")
chosen_mask[chosen_mask != 0] = 255
chosen_mask[chosen_mask == 0] = 1
chosen_mask[chosen_mask == 255] = 0
chosen_mask[chosen_mask == 1] = 255

# create a base blank mask
width = 1024
height = 1024
mask = Image.new("RGBA", (width, height), (0, 0, 0, 1))  # create an opaque image mask

# Convert mask back to pixels to add our mask replacing the third dimension
pix = np.array(mask)
pix[:, :, 3] = chosen_mask

# Convert pixels back to an RGBA image and display
new_mask = Image.fromarray(pix, "RGBA")
new_mask

image generated by notebook
# We'll save this mask for re-use for our edit
new_mask.save(os.path.join(mask_dir, "new_mask.png"))

Create new image
Now we'll combine our original image with the mask and the Edit endpoint for DALLE to inpaint the transparent area according to a new prompt. (as 0f January 2024 dall-e-2 is the only model that supports edits)

# edit an image
edit_response = client.images.edit(
    image=open(chosen_image, "rb"),  # from the generation section
    mask=open(os.path.join(mask_dir, "new_mask.png"), "rb"),  # from right above
    prompt="Brilliant leather Lederhosen with a formal look, detailed, intricate, photorealistic",  # provide a prompt to fill the space
    n=3,
    size="1024x1024",
    response_format="url",
)

edit_filepaths = process_dalle_images(edit_response, "edits", edit_image_dir)

# Display your beautiful creations!
%matplotlib inline

# figure size in inches optional
rcParams["figure.figsize"] = 11 ,8

Using Weaviate with generative OpenAI module for generative search

OpenAI Logo
Sebastian Witalec
May 21, 2023
Open in Github
This notebook is prepared for a scenario where:

Your data is already in Weaviate
You want to use Weaviate with the Generative OpenAI module (generative-openai).
Prerequisites
This cookbook only coveres Generative Search examples, however, it doesn't cover the configuration and data imports.

In order to make the most of this cookbook, please complete the Getting Started cookbook first, where you will learn the essentials of working with Weaviate and import the demo data.

Checklist:

completed Getting Started cookbook,
crated a Weaviate instance,
imported data into your Weaviate instance,
you have an OpenAI API key
===========================================================

Prepare your OpenAI API key
The OpenAI API key is used for vectorization of your data at import, and for running queries.

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys.

Once you get your key, please add it to your environment variables as OPENAI_API_KEY.

# Export OpenAI API Key
!export OPENAI_API_KEY="your key"

# Test that your OpenAI API key is correctly set as an environment variable
# Note. if you run this notebook locally, you will need to reload your terminal and the notebook for the env variables to be live.
import os

# Note. alternatively you can set a temporary env variable like this:
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = 'your-key-goes-here'

if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") is not None:
    print ("OPENAI_API_KEY is ready")
else:
    print ("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not found")

Connect to your Weaviate instance
In this section, we will:

test env variable OPENAI_API_KEY – make sure you completed the step in #Prepare-your-OpenAI-API-key
connect to your Weaviate with your OpenAI API Key
and test the client connection
The client
After this step, the client object will be used to perform all Weaviate-related operations.

import weaviate
from datasets import load_dataset
import os

# Connect to your Weaviate instance
client = weaviate.Client(
    url="https://your-wcs-instance-name.weaviate.network/",
    # url="http://localhost:8080/",
    auth_client_secret=weaviate.auth.AuthApiKey(api_key="<YOUR-WEAVIATE-API-KEY>"), # comment out this line if you are not using authentication for your Weaviate instance (i.e. for locally deployed instances)
    additional_headers={
        "X-OpenAI-Api-Key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    }
)

# Check if your instance is live and ready
# This should return `True`
client.is_ready()

Generative Search
Weaviate offers a Generative Search OpenAI module, which generates responses based on the data stored in your Weaviate instance.

The way you construct a generative search query is very similar to a standard semantic search query in Weaviate.

For example:

search in "Articles",
return "title", "content", "url"
look for objects related to "football clubs"
limit results to 5 objects
    result = (
        client.query
        .get("Articles", ["title", "content", "url"])
        .with_near_text("concepts": "football clubs")
        .with_limit(5)
        # generative query will go here
        .do()
    )

Now, you can add with_generate() function to apply generative transformation. with_generate takes either:

single_prompt - to generate a response for each returned object,
grouped_task – to generate a single response from all returned objects.
def generative_search_per_item(query, collection_name):
    prompt = "Summarize in a short tweet the following content: {content}"

    result = (
        client.query
        .get(collection_name, ["title", "content", "url"])
        .with_near_text({ "concepts": [query], "distance": 0.7 })
        .with_limit(5)
        .with_generate(single_prompt=prompt)
        .do()
    )
    
    # Check for errors
    if ("errors" in result):
        print ("\033[91mYou probably have run out of OpenAI API calls for the current minute – the limit is set at 60 per minute.")
        raise Exception(result["errors"][0]['message'])
    
    return result["data"]["Get"][collection_name]

query_result = generative_search_per_item("football clubs", "Article")

for i, article in enumerate(query_result):
    print(f"{i+1}. { article['title']}")
    print(article['_additional']['generate']['singleResult']) # print generated response
    print("-----------------------")

def generative_search_group(query, collection_name):
    generateTask = "Explain what these have in common"

    result = (
        client.query
        .get(collection_name, ["title", "content", "url"])
        .with_near_text({ "concepts": [query], "distance": 0.7 })
        .with_generate(grouped_task=generateTask)
        .with_limit(5)
        .do()
    )
    
    # Check for errors
    if ("errors" in result):
        print ("\033[91mYou probably have run out of OpenAI API calls for the current minute – the limit is set at 60 per minute.")
        raise Exception(result["errors"][0]['message'])
    
    return result["data"]["Get"][collection_name]

query_result = generative_search_group("football clubs", "Article")

print (query_result[0]['_additional']['generate']['groupedResult'])
How to call functions with chat models

OpenAI Logo

OpenAI Logo
Colin Jarvis, Joe Palermo
Jun 12, 2023
Open in Github
This notebook covers how to use the Chat Completions API in combination with external functions to extend the capabilities of GPT models.

tools is an optional parameter in the Chat Completion API which can be used to provide function specifications. The purpose of this is to enable models to generate function arguments which adhere to the provided specifications. Note that the API will not actually execute any function calls. It is up to developers to execute function calls using model outputs.

Within the tools parameter, if the functions parameter is provided then by default the model will decide when it is appropriate to use one of the functions. The API can be forced to use a specific function by setting the tool_choice parameter to {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}. The API can also be forced to not use any function by setting the tool_choice parameter to "none". If a function is used, the output will contain "finish_reason": "tool_calls" in the response, as well as a tool_calls object that has the name of the function and the generated function arguments.

Overview
This notebook contains the following 2 sections:

How to generate function arguments: Specify a set of functions and use the API to generate function arguments.
How to call functions with model generated arguments: Close the loop by actually executing functions with model generated arguments.

def chat_completion_request(messages, tools=None, tool_choice=None, model=GPT_MODEL):

        return response
    except Exception as e:

        print(f"Exception: {e}")
        return e

        "assistant": "blue",
        "function": "magenta",
    }
    
    for message in messages:
        if message["role"] == "system":
            print(colored(f"system: {message['content']}\n", role_to_color[message["role"]]))
        elif message["role"] == "user":
            print(colored(f"user: {message['content']}\n", role_to_color[message["role"]]))
        elif message["role"] == "assistant" and message.get("function_call"):
            print(colored(f"assistant: {message['function_call']}\n", role_to_color[message["role"]]))
        elif message["role"] == "assistant" and not message.get("function_call"):
            print(colored(f"assistant: {message['content']}\n", role_to_color[message["role"]]))
        elif message["role"] == "function":
            print(colored(f"function ({message['name']}): {message['content']}\n", role_to_color[message["role"]]))

Basic concepts
Let's create some function specifications to interface with a hypothetical weather API. We'll pass these function specification to the Chat Completions API in order to generate function arguments that adhere to the specification.

tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_current_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
                    },
                    "format": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                        "description": "The temperature unit to use. Infer this from the users location.",
                    },
                },
                "required": ["location", "format"],
            },
        }
    },
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_n_day_weather_forecast",
            "description": "Get an N-day weather forecast",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
                    },
                    "format": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                        "description": "The temperature unit to use. Infer this from the users location.",
                    },
                    "num_days": {
                        "type": "integer",
                        "description": "The number of days to forecast",
                    }
                },
                "required": ["location", "format", "num_days"]
            },
        }
    },
]

If we prompt the model about the current weather, it will respond with some clarifying questions.

messages = []
messages.append({"role": "system", "content": "Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous."})
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like today"})
chat_response = chat_completion_request(
    messages, tools=tools
)
assistant_message = chat_response.choices[0].message
messages.append(assistant_message)
assistant_message

ChatCompletionMessage(content='Sure, can you please provide me with the name of your city and state?', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
Once we provide the missing information, it will generate the appropriate function arguments for us.

messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "I'm in Glasgow, Scotland."})
chat_response = chat_completion_request(
    messages, tools=tools
)
assistant_message = chat_response.choices[0].message
messages.append(assistant_message)
assistant_message

ChatCompletionMessage(content=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(id='call_xb7QwwNnx90LkmhtlW0YrgP2', function=Function(arguments='{"location":"Glasgow, Scotland","format":"celsius"}', name='get_current_weather'), type='function')])
By prompting it differently, we can get it to target the other function we've told it about.

messages = []
messages.append({"role": "system", "content": "Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous."})
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather going to be like in Glasgow, Scotland over the next x days"})
chat_response = chat_completion_request(
    messages, tools=tools
)
assistant_message = chat_response.choices[0].message
messages.append(assistant_message)
assistant_message

ChatCompletionMessage(content='To provide you with the weather forecast for Glasgow, Scotland, could you please specify the number of days you would like the forecast for?', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
Once again, the model is asking us for clarification because it doesn't have enough information yet. In this case it already knows the location for the forecast, but it needs to know how many days are required in the forecast.

messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "5 days"})
chat_response = chat_completion_request(
    messages, tools=tools
)
chat_response.choices[0]

Choice(finish_reason='tool_calls', index=0, logprobs=None, message=ChatCompletionMessage(content=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(id='call_34PBraFdNN6KR95uD5rHF8Aw', function=Function(arguments='{"location":"Glasgow, Scotland","format":"celsius","num_days":5}', name='get_n_day_weather_forecast'), type='function')]))
Forcing the use of specific functions or no function
We can force the model to use a specific function, for example get_n_day_weather_forecast by using the function_call argument. By doing so, we force the model to make assumptions about how to use it.

# in this cell we force the model to use get_n_day_weather_forecast
messages = []
messages.append({"role": "system", "content": "Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous."})
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "Give me a weather report for Toronto, Canada."})
chat_response = chat_completion_request(
    messages, tools=tools, tool_choice={"type": "function", "function": {"name": "get_n_day_weather_forecast"}}
)
chat_response.choices[0].message

ChatCompletionMessage(content=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(id='call_FImGxrLowOAOszCaaQqQWmEN', function=Function(arguments='{"location":"Toronto, Canada","format":"celsius","num_days":7}', name='get_n_day_weather_forecast'), type='function')])
# if we don't force the model to use get_n_day_weather_forecast it may not
messages = []
messages.append({"role": "system", "content": "Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous."})
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "Give me a weather report for Toronto, Canada."})
chat_response = chat_completion_request(
    messages, tools=tools
)
chat_response.choices[0].message

ChatCompletionMessage(content=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(id='call_n84kYFqjNFDPNGDEnjnrd2KC', function=Function(arguments='{"location": "Toronto, Canada", "format": "celsius"}', name='get_current_weather'), type='function'), ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(id='call_AEs3AFhJc9pn42hWSbHTaIDh', function=Function(arguments='{"location": "Toronto, Canada", "format": "celsius", "num_days": 3}', name='get_n_day_weather_forecast'), type='function')])
We can also force the model to not use a function at all. By doing so we prevent it from producing a proper function call.

messages = []
messages.append({"role": "system", "content": "Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous."})
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "Give me the current weather (use Celcius) for Toronto, Canada."})
chat_response = chat_completion_request(
    messages, tools=tools, tool_choice="none"
)
chat_response.choices[0].message

ChatCompletionMessage(content="Sure, I'll get the current weather for Toronto, Canada in Celsius.", role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)
Parallel Function Calling
Newer models such as gpt-4o or gpt-3.5-turbo can call multiple functions in one turn.

messages = []
messages.append({"role": "system", "content": "Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous."})
messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather going to be like in San Francisco and Glasgow over the next 4 days"})
chat_response = chat_completion_request(
    messages, tools=tools, model=GPT_MODEL
)

assistant_message = chat_response.choices[0].message.tool_calls
assistant_message

[ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(id='call_ObhLiJwaHwc3U1KyB4Pdpx8y', function=Function(arguments='{"location": "San Francisco, CA", "format": "fahrenheit", "num_days": 4}', name='get_n_day_weather_forecast'), type='function'),
 ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(id='call_5YRgeZ0MGBMFKE3hZiLouwg7', function=Function(arguments='{"location": "Glasgow, SCT", "format": "celsius", "num_days": 4}', name='get_n_day_weather_forecast'), type='function')]
How to call functions with model generated arguments
In our next example, we'll demonstrate how to execute functions whose inputs are model-generated, and use this to implement an agent that can answer questions for us about a database. For simplicity we'll use the Chinook sample database.

Note: SQL generation can be high-risk in a production environment since models are not perfectly reliable at generating correct SQL.

Specifying a function to execute SQL queries
First let's define some helpful utility functions to extract data from a SQLite database.

import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("data/Chinook.db")
print("Opened database successfully")

Opened database successfully
def get_table_names(conn):
    """Return a list of table names."""
    table_names = []
    tables = conn.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';")
    for table in tables.fetchall():
        table_names.append(table[0])
    return table_names


def get_column_names(conn, table_name):
    """Return a list of column names."""
    column_names = []
    columns = conn.execute(f"PRAGMA table_info('{table_name}');").fetchall()
    for col in columns:
        column_names.append(col[1])
    return column_names


def get_database_info(conn):
    """Return a list of dicts containing the table name and columns for each table in the database."""
    table_dicts = []
    for table_name in get_table_names(conn):
        columns_names = get_column_names(conn, table_name)
        table_dicts.append({"table_name": table_name, "column_names": columns_names})
    return table_dicts

Now can use these utility functions to extract a representation of the database schema.

database_schema_dict = get_database_info(conn)
database_schema_string = "\n".join(
    [
        f"Table: {table['table_name']}\nColumns: {', '.join(table['column_names'])}"
        for table in database_schema_dict
    ]
)

As before, we'll define a function specification for the function we'd like the API to generate arguments for. Notice that we are inserting the database schema into the function specification. This will be important for the model to know about.

tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "ask_database",
            "description": "Use this function to answer user questions about music. Input should be a fully formed SQL query.",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "query": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": f"""
                                SQL query extracting info to answer the user's question.
                                SQL should be written using this database schema:
                                {database_schema_string}
                                The query should be returned in plain text, not in JSON.
                                """,
                    }
                },
                "required": ["query"],
            },
        }
    }
]

Executing SQL queries
Now let's implement the function that will actually excute queries against the database.

def ask_database(conn, query):
    """Function to query SQLite database with a provided SQL query."""
    try:
        results = str(conn.execute(query).fetchall())
    except Exception as e:
        results = f"query failed with error: {e}"
    return results

Steps to invoke a function call using Chat Completions API:
Step 1: Prompt the model with content that may result in model selecting a tool to use. The description of the tools such as a function names and signature is defined in the 'Tools' list and passed to the model in API call. If selected, the function name and parameters are included in the response.

Step 2: Check programmatically if model wanted to call a function. If true, proceed to step 3.
Step 3: Extract the function name and parameters from response, call the function with parameters. Append the result to messages.
Step 4: Invoke the chat completions API with the message list to get the response.

# Step #1: Prompt with content that may result in function call. In this case the model can identify the information requested by the user is potentially available in the database schema passed to the model in Tools description. 
messages = [{
    "role":"user", 
    "content": "What is the name of the album with the most tracks?"
}]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model='gpt-4o', 
    messages=messages, 
    tools= tools, 
    tool_choice="auto"
)

# Append the message to messages list
response_message = response.choices[0].message 
messages.append(response_message)

print(response_message)

ChatCompletionMessage(content=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(id='call_wDN8uLjq2ofuU6rVx1k8Gw0e', function=Function(arguments='{"query":"SELECT Album.Title, COUNT(Track.TrackId) AS TrackCount FROM Album INNER JOIN Track ON Album.AlbumId = Track.AlbumId GROUP BY Album.Title ORDER BY TrackCount DESC LIMIT 1;"}', name='ask_database'), type='function')])
# Step 2: determine if the response from the model includes a tool call.   
tool_calls = response_message.tool_calls
if tool_calls:
    # If true the model will return the name of the tool / function to call and the argument(s)  
    tool_call_id = tool_calls[0].id
    tool_function_name = tool_calls[0].function.name
    tool_query_string = json.loads(tool_calls[0].function.arguments)['query']

    # Step 3: Call the function and retrieve results. Append the results to the messages list.      
    if tool_function_name == 'ask_database':
        results = ask_database(conn, tool_query_string)
        
        messages.append({
            "role":"tool", 
            "tool_call_id":tool_call_id, 
            "name": tool_function_name, 
            "content":results
        })
        
        # Step 4: Invoke the chat completions API with the function response appended to the messages list
        # Note that messages with role 'tool' must be a response to a preceding message with 'tool_calls'
        model_response_with_function_call = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=messages,
        )  # get a new response from the model where it can see the function response
        print(model_response_with_function_call.choices[0].message.content)
    else: 
        print(f"Error: function {tool_function_name} does not exist")
else: 
    # Model did not identify a function to call, result can be returned to the user 
    print(response_message.content) 

The album with the most tracks is titled "Greatest Hits," which contains 57 tracks.

How to use functions with a knowledge base

OpenAI Logo
Colin Jarvis
Jun 13, 2023
Open in Github
This notebook builds on the concepts in the argument generation notebook, by creating an agent with access to a knowledge base and two functions that it can call based on the user requirement.

We'll create an agent that uses data from arXiv to answer questions about academic subjects. It has two functions at its disposal:

get_articles: A function that gets arXiv articles on a subject and summarizes them for the user with links.
read_article_and_summarize: This function takes one of the previously searched articles, reads it in its entirety and summarizes the core argument, evidence and conclusions.
This will get you comfortable with a multi-function workflow that can choose from multiple services, and where some of the data from the first function is persisted to be used by the second.

Walkthrough
This cookbook takes you through the following workflow:

Search utilities: Creating the two functions that access arXiv for answers.
Configure Agent: Building up the Agent behaviour that will assess the need for a function and, if one is required, call that function and present results back to the agent.
arXiv conversation: Put all of this together in live conversation.

Search utilities
We'll first set up some utilities that will underpin our two functions.

Downloaded papers will be stored in a directory (we use ./data/papers here). We create a file arxiv_library.csv to store the embeddings and details for downloaded papers to retrieve against using summarize_text.

directory = './data/papers'

# Check if the directory already exists
if not os.path.exists(directory):
    # If the directory doesn't exist, create it and any necessary intermediate directories
    os.makedirs(directory)
    print(f"Directory '{directory}' created successfully.")
else:
    # If the directory already exists, print a message indicating it
    print(f"Directory '{directory}' already exists.")

Directory './data/papers' already exists.
# Set a directory to store downloaded papers
data_dir = os.path.join(os.curdir, "data", "papers")
paper_dir_filepath = "./data/arxiv_library.csv"

# Generate a blank dataframe where we can store downloaded files

Summarizing into overall summary
print(chat_test_response.choices[0].message.content)

Core Argument:
- The academic paper explores the connection between the transverse field Ising (TFI) model and the ϕ4 model, highlighting the analogy between topological solitary waves in the ϕ4 model and the effect of the transverse field on spin flips in the TFI model.
- The study reveals regimes of memory/loss of memory and coherence/decoherence in the classical ϕ4 model subjected to periodic perturbations, which are essential in annealing phenomena.
- The exploration of the analogy between lower-dimensional linear quantum systems and higher-dimensional classical nonlinear systems can lead to a deeper understanding of information processing in these systems.

Evidence:
- The authors analyze the dynamics and relaxation of weakly coupled ϕ4 chains through numerical simulations, observing kink and breather excitations and investigating the structural phase transition associated with the double well potential.
- The critical temperature (Tc) approaches zero as the inter-chain coupling strength (C⊥) approaches zero, but there is a finite Tc for C⊥>0.
- The spectral function shows peaks corresponding to particle motion across the double-well potential at higher temperatures and oscillations in a single well at lower temperatures.
- The soft-mode frequency (ωs) decreases as temperature approaches Ts, the dynamical crossover temperature.
- The relaxation process of the average displacement (QD) is controlled by spatially extended vibrations and large kink densities.
- The mean domain size (⟨DS⟩) exhibits an algebraic decay for finite C⊥>0.
- The probability of larger domain sizes is higher before a kick compared to after a kick for C⊥>0.

Conclusions:
- The authors suggest further exploration of the crossover between decoherence and finite coherence in periodic-kick strength space.
- They propose extending the study to different kick profiles, introducing kink defects, and studying weakly-coupled chains in higher dimensions.
- Recognizing similarities between classical nonlinear equations and quantum linear ones in information processing is important.
- Future research directions include investigating the dynamics of quantum annealing, measurement and memory in the periodically driven complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and the behavior of solitons and domain walls in various systems.

In this example notebook, we showcase how to perform financial analysis over 10-K documents with the LlamaIndex framework with just a few lines of code.

Introduction
LLamaIndex
LlamaIndex is a data framework for LLM applications. You can get started with just a few lines of code and build a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system in minutes. For more advanced users, LlamaIndex offers a rich toolkit for ingesting and indexing your data, modules for retrieval and re-ranking, and composable components for building custom query engines.

See full documentation for more details.

Financial Analysis over 10-K documents
A key part of a financial analyst's job is to extract information and synthesize insight from long financial documents. A great example is the 10-K form - an annual report required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), that gives a comprehensive summary of a company's financial performance. These documents typically run hundred of pages in length, and contain domain-specific terminology that makes it challenging for a layperson to digest quickly.

We showcase how LlamaIndex can support a financial analyst in quickly extracting information and synthesize insights across multiple documents with very little coding.

Setup
To begin, we need to install the llama-index library

!pip install llama-index pypdf

Now, we import all modules used in this tutorial

from langchain import OpenAI

from llama_index import SimpleDirectoryReader, ServiceContext, VectorStoreIndex
from llama_index import set_global_service_context
from llama_index.response.pprint_utils import pprint_response
from llama_index.tools import QueryEngineTool, ToolMetadata
from llama_index.query_engine import SubQuestionQueryEngine

Before we start, we can configure the LLM provider and model that will power our RAG system.
Here, we pick gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct from OpenAI.

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0, model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", max_tokens=-1)

We construct a ServiceContext and set it as the global default, so all subsequent operations that depends on LLM calls will use the model we configured here.

service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm=llm)
set_global_service_context(service_context=service_context)

Data Loading and Indexing
Now, we load and parse 2 PDFs (one for Uber 10-K in 2021 and another for Lyft 10-k in 2021).
Under the hood, the PDFs are converted to plain text Document objects, separate by page.

Note: this operation might take a while to run, since each document is more than 100 pages.

lyft_docs = SimpleDirectoryReader(input_files=["../data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf"]).load_data()
uber_docs = SimpleDirectoryReader(input_files=["../data/10k/uber_2021.pdf"]).load_data()

print(f'Loaded lyft 10-K with {len(lyft_docs)} pages')
print(f'Loaded Uber 10-K with {len(uber_docs)} pages')

Loaded lyft 10-K with 238 pages
Loaded Uber 10-K with 307 pages
Now, we can build an (in-memory) VectorStoreIndex over the documents that we've loaded.

Note: this operation might take a while to run, since it calls OpenAI API for computing vector embedding over document chunks.

lyft_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(lyft_docs)
uber_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(uber_docs)

Simple QA
Now we are ready to run some queries against our indices!
To do so, we first configure a QueryEngine, which just captures a set of configurations for how we want to query the underlying index.

For a VectorStoreIndex, the most common configuration to adjust is similarity_top_k which controls how many document chunks (which we call Node objects) are retrieved to use as context for answering our question.

lyft_engine = lyft_index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=3)

uber_engine = uber_index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=3)

Let's see some queries in action!

response = await lyft_engine.aquery('What is the revenue of Lyft in 2021? Answer in millions with page reference')

print(response)


$3,208.3 million (page 63)
response = await uber_engine.aquery('What is the revenue of Uber in 2021? Answer in millions, with page reference')

print(response)


$17,455 (page 53)
Advanced QA - Compare and Contrast
For more complex financial analysis, one often needs to reference multiple documents.

As a example, let's take a look at how to do compare-and-contrast queries over both Lyft and Uber financials.
For this, we build a SubQuestionQueryEngine, which breaks down a complex compare-and-contrast query, into simpler sub-questions to execute on respective sub query engine backed by individual indices.

query_engine_tools = [
    QueryEngineTool(
        query_engine=lyft_engine, 
        metadata=ToolMetadata(name='lyft_10k', description='Provides information about Lyft financials for year 2021')
    ),
    QueryEngineTool(
        query_engine=uber_engine, 
        metadata=ToolMetadata(name='uber_10k', description='Provides information about Uber financials for year 2021')
    ),
]

s_engine = SubQuestionQueryEngine.from_defaults(query_engine_tools=query_engine_tools)

Let's see these queries in action!

response = await s_engine.aquery('Compare and contrast the customer segments and geographies that grew the fastest')

[36;1m[1;3m[uber_10k] Q: What customer segments grew the fastest for Uber
[0m[36;1m[1;3m[uber_10k] A: in 2021?

The customer segments that grew the fastest for Uber in 2021 were its Mobility Drivers, Couriers, Riders, and Eaters. These segments experienced growth due to the continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19, as well as Uber's introduction of its Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass, and Rides Pass membership programs. Additionally, Uber's marketplace-centric advertising helped to connect merchants and brands with its platform network, further driving growth.
[0m[33;1m[1;3m[uber_10k] Q: What geographies grew the fastest for Uber
[0m[33;1m[1;3m[uber_10k] A: 
Based on the context information, it appears that Uber experienced the most growth in large metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, Miami, New York City, Sao Paulo, and London. Additionally, Uber experienced growth in suburban and rural areas, as well as in countries such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain.

[0m[38;5;200m[1;3m[lyft_10k] A: 
The customer segments that grew the fastest for Lyft were ridesharing, light vehicles, and public transit. Ridesharing grew as Lyft was able to predict demand and proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. Light vehicles grew as users were looking for options that were more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. Public transit grew as Lyft integrated third-party public transit data into the Lyft App to offer users a robust view of transportation options around them.

The revenue growth of Uber from 2020 to 2021 was 57%, or 54% on a constant currency basis, while the revenue growth of Lyft from 2020 to 2021 was 36%. This means that Uber had a higher revenue growth than Lyft from 2020 to 2021.
OpenAI's audio transcription API has an optional parameter called prompt.

The prompt is intended to help stitch together multiple audio segments. By submitting the prior segment's transcript via the prompt, the Whisper model can use that context to better understand the speech and maintain a consistent writing style.

However, prompts do not need to be genuine transcripts from prior audio segments. Fictitious prompts can be submitted to steer the model to use particular spellings or styles.

This notebook shares two techniques for using fictitious prompts to steer the model outputs:

Transcript generation: GPT can convert instructions into fictitious transcripts for Whisper to emulate.
Spelling guide: A spelling guide can tell the model how to spell names of people, products, companies, etc.
These techniques are not especially reliable, but can be useful in some situations.

Comparison with GPT prompting
Prompting Whisper is not the same as prompting GPT. For example, if you submit an attempted instruction like "Format lists in Markdown format", the model will not comply, as it follows the style of the prompt, rather than any instructions contained within.

In addition, the prompt is limited to only 224 tokens. If the prompt is longer than 224 tokens, only the final 224 tokens of the prompt will be considered; all prior tokens will be silently ignored. The tokenizer used is the multilingual Whisper tokenizer.

To get good results, craft examples that portray your desired style.

Setup
To get started, let's:

Import the OpenAI Python library (if you don't have it, you'll need to install it with pip install openai)
Download a few example audio files
# imports
from openai import OpenAI  # for making OpenAI API calls
import urllib  # for downloading example audio files
import os

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))

# set download paths
up_first_remote_filepath = "https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/upfirstpodcastchunkthree.wav"
bbq_plans_remote_filepath = "https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/bbq_plans.wav"
product_names_remote_filepath = "https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/product_names.wav"

# set local save locations
up_first_filepath = "data/upfirstpodcastchunkthree.wav"
bbq_plans_filepath = "data/bbq_plans.wav"
product_names_filepath = "data/product_names.wav"

# download example audio files and save locally
urllib.request.urlretrieve(up_first_remote_filepath, up_first_filepath)
urllib.request.urlretrieve(bbq_plans_remote_filepath, bbq_plans_filepath)
urllib.request.urlretrieve(product_names_remote_filepath, product_names_filepath)

('data/product_names.wav', <http.client.HTTPMessage at 0x1105ac490>)
As a baseline, we'll transcribe an NPR podcast segment
Our audio file for this example will be a segment of the NPR podcast, Up First.

Let's get our baseline transcription, then introduce prompts.

# define a wrapper function for seeing how prompts affect transcriptions
def transcribe(audio_filepath, prompt: str) -> str:
    """Given a prompt, transcribe the audio file."""
    transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
        file=open(audio_filepath, "rb"),
        model="whisper-1",
        prompt=prompt,
    )
    return transcript.text

# baseline transcription with no prompt
transcribe(up_first_filepath, prompt="")

"I stick contacts in my eyes. Do you really? Yeah. That works okay? You don't have to, like, just kind of pain in the butt every day to do that? No, it is. It is. And I sometimes just kind of miss the eye. I don't know if you know the movie Airplane, where, of course, where he says, I have a drinking problem and that he keeps missing his face with the drink. That's me and the contact lens. Surely, you must know that I know the movie Airplane. I do. I do know that. Stop calling me Shirley. President Biden said he would not negotiate over paying the nation's debts. But he is meeting today with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Other leaders of Congress will also attend. So how much progress can they make? I'm E. Martinez with Steve Inskeep, and this is Up First from NPR News. Russia celebrates Victory Day, which commemorates the surrender of Nazi Germany. Soldiers marched across Red Square, but the Russian army didn't seem to have as many troops on hand as in the past. So what does this ritual say about the war Russia is fighting right now?"
Transcripts follow the style of the prompt
In the unprompted transcript, 'President Biden' is capitalized. However, if we pass in a fictitious prompt of 'president biden' in lowercase, Whisper matches the style and generates a transcript in all lowercase.

# lowercase prompt
transcribe(up_first_filepath, prompt="president biden")

"I stick contacts in my eyes. Do you really? Yeah. That works okay? You don't have to, like, just kind of pain in the butt every day to do that? No, it is. It is. And I sometimes just kind of miss the eye. I don't know if you know the movie Airplane? Yes. Of course. Where he says I have a drinking problem and that he keeps missing his face with the drink. That's me and the contact lens. Surely, you must know that I know the movie Airplane. I do. I do know that. Don't call me Shirley. Stop calling me Shirley. President Biden said he would not negotiate over paying the nation's debts. But he is meeting today with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Other leaders of Congress will also attend. So how much progress can they make? I'm E. Martinez with Steve Inskeep and this is Up First from NPR News. Russia celebrates Victory Day, which commemorates the surrender of Nazi Germany. Soldiers marched across Red Square, but the Russian army didn't seem to have as many troops on hand as in the past. So what does this ritual say about the war Russia is fighting right now?"
Be aware that when prompts are short, Whisper may be less reliable at following their style.

# short prompts are less reliable
transcribe(up_first_filepath, prompt="president biden.")

"I stick contacts in my eyes. Do you really? Yeah. That works okay? You don't have to, like, just kind of pain in the butt every day to do that? No, it is. It is. And I sometimes just kind of miss the eye. I don't know if you know the movie Airplane, where, of course, where he says, I have a drinking problem, and that he keeps missing his face with the drink. That's me and the contact lens. Surely, you must know that I know the movie Airplane. I do. I do know that. Stop calling me Shirley.

Long prompts may be more reliable at steering Whisper.

# long prompts are more reliable
transcribe(up_first_filepath, prompt="i have some advice for you. multiple sentences help establish a pattern. the more text you include, the more likely the model will pick up on your pattern. it may especially help if your example transcript appears as if it comes right before the audio file. in this case, that could mean mentioning the contacts i stick in my eyes.")

"i stick contacts in my eyes. do you really? yeah. that works okay? you don't have to, like, just kind of pain in the butt? no, it is. it is. and i sometimes just kind of miss the eye. i don't know if you know, um, the movie airplane? yes. of course. where he says i have a drinking problem. and that he keeps missing his face with the drink. that's me in the contact lens. surely, you must know that i know the movie airplane. i do. i do know that. don't call me surely. stop calling me surely. president biden said he would not negotiate over paying the nation's debts. but he is meeting today with house speaker kevin mccarthy. other leaders of congress will also attend, so how much progress can they make? i'm amy martinez with steve inskeep, and this is up first from npr news. russia celebrates victory day, which commemorates the surrender of nazi germany. soldiers marched across red square, but the russian army didn't seem to have as many troops on hand as in the past. so what does this ritual say about the war russia is fighting right now?"
Whisper is also less likely to follow rare or odd styles.

# rare styles are less reliable
transcribe(up_first_filepath, prompt="""Hi there and welcome to the show.
###
Today we are quite excited.
###
Let's jump right in.
###""")

"I stick contacts in my eyes. Do you really? Yeah. That works okay. You don't have to like, it's not a pain in the butt. It is. And I sometimes just kind of miss the eye. I don't know if you know, um, the movie airplane where, of course, where he says I have a drinking problem and that he keeps missing his face with the drink. That's me in the contact lens.

Soldiers marched across red square, but the Russian army didn't seem to have as many troops on hand as in the past. So what does this ritual say about the war? Russia is fighting right now."
Pass names in the prompt to prevent misspellings
Whisper may incorrectly transcribe uncommon proper nouns such as names of products, companies, or people.

We'll illustrate with an example audio file full of product names.

# baseline transcription with no prompt
transcribe(product_names_filepath, prompt="")

To get Whisper to use our preferred spellings, let's pass the product and company names in the prompt, as a glossary for Whisper to follow.

# adding the correct spelling of the product name helps
transcribe(product_names_filepath, prompt="QuirkQuid Quill Inc, P3-Quattro, O3-Omni, B3-BondX, E3-Equity, W3-WrapZ, O2-Outlier, U3-UniFund, M3-Mover")

Now, let's switch to another audio recording authored specifically for this demonstration, on the topic of a odd barbecue.

To begin, we'll establish our baseline transcript using Whisper.

# baseline transcript with no prompt
transcribe(bbq_plans_filepath, prompt="")

"Hello, my name is Preston Tuggle. I'm based in New York City. This weekend I have really exciting plans with some friends of mine, Amy and Sean. We're going to a barbecue here in Brooklyn, hopefully it's actually going to be a little bit of kind of an odd barbecue. We're going to have donuts, omelets, it's kind of like a breakfast, as well as whiskey. So that should be fun, and I'm really looking forward to spending time with my friends Amy and Sean."
While Whisper's transcription was accurate, it had to guess at various spellings. For example, it assumed the friends' names were spelled Amy and Sean rather than Aimee and Shawn. Let's see if we can steer the spelling with a prompt.

# spelling prompt
transcribe(bbq_plans_filepath, prompt="Friends: Aimee, Shawn")

"Hello, my name is Preston Tuggle. I'm based in New York City. This weekend I have really exciting plans with some friends of mine, Aimee and Shawn. We're going to a barbecue here in Brooklyn. Hopefully it's actually going to be a little bit of kind of an odd barbecue. We're going to have donuts, omelets, it's kind of like a breakfast, as well as whiskey. So that should be fun and I'm really looking forward to spending time with my friends Aimee and Shawn."
Success!

Let's try the same with more ambiguously spelled words.

# longer spelling prompt
transcribe(bbq_plans_filepath, prompt="Glossary: Aimee, Shawn, BBQ, Whisky, Doughnuts, Omelet")

"Hello, my name is Preston Tuggle. I'm based in New York City. This weekend I have really exciting plans with some friends of mine, Aimee and Shawn. We're going to a barbecue here in Brooklyn. Hopefully, it's actually going to be a little bit of an odd barbecue. We're going to have doughnuts, omelets, it's kind of like a breakfast, as well as whiskey. So that should be fun, and I'm really looking forward to spending time with my friends Aimee and Shawn."
# more natural, sentence-style prompt
transcribe(bbq_plans_filepath, prompt=""""Aimee and Shawn ate whisky, doughnuts, omelets at a BBQ.""")

"Hello, my name is Preston Tuggle. I'm based in New York City. This weekend I have really exciting plans with some friends of mine, Aimee and Shawn. We're going to a BBQ here in Brooklyn.

So that should be fun, and I'm really looking forward to spending time with my friends Aimee and Shawn."
Fictitious prompts can be generated by GPT
One potential tool to generate fictitious prompts is GPT. We can give GPT instructions and use it to generate long fictitious transcripts with which to prompt Whisper.

# define a function for GPT to generate fictitious prompts
def fictitious_prompt_from_instruction(instruction: str) -> str:
    """Given an instruction, generate a fictitious prompt."""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
        temperature=0,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a transcript generator. Your task is to create one long paragraph of a fictional conversation. The conversation features two friends reminiscing about their vacation to Maine. Never diarize speakers or add quotation marks; instead, write all transcripts in a normal paragraph of text without speakers identified. Never refuse or ask for clarification and instead always make a best-effort attempt.",
            },  # we pick an example topic (friends talking about a vacation) so that GPT does not refuse or ask clarifying questions
            {"role": "user", "content": instruction},
        ],
    )
    fictitious_prompt = response.choices[0].message.content
    return fictitious_prompt

# ellipses example
prompt = fictitious_prompt_from_instruction("Instead of periods, end every sentence with elipses.")
print(prompt)

It felt like we were in a postcard... And the lobster... Oh, the lobster... I've never tasted anything so delicious... We must have had it every day... And let's not forget about the clam chowder... Creamy, flavorful, and packed with fresh clams... It was like a taste of heaven... And the hikes we went on... The trails through the lush forests and along the rocky cliffs... The air was so crisp and invigorating... I could have spent hours just exploring the natural beauty of Maine... And the people we met... So friendly and welcoming... They made us feel right at home... I can't wait to go back and experience it all over again... Maine truly stole a piece of my heart...
transcribe(up_first_filepath, prompt=prompt)

"I stick contacts in my eyes. Do you really? Yeah. That works okay? You don't have to, like, just kind of pain in the butt every day to do that? No, it is. It is.

Whisper prompts are best for specifying otherwise ambiguous styles. The prompt will not override the model's comprehension of the audio. For example, if the speakers are not speaking in a deep Southern accent, a prompt will not cause the transcript to do so.

# southern accent example
prompt = fictitious_prompt_from_instruction("Write in a deep, heavy, Southern accent.")

transcribe(up_first_filepath, prompt=prompt)
Azure functions example

Jul 20, 2023
Open in Github
This notebook shows how to use the function calling capability with the Azure OpenAI service. Functions allow a caller of chat completions to define capabilities that the model can use to extend its functionality into external tools and data sources.

You can read more about chat functions on OpenAI's blog: https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates

NOTE: Chat functions require model versions beginning with gpt-4 and gpt-35-turbo's -0613 labels. They are not supported by older versions of the models.

Setup
First, we install the necessary dependencies and import the libraries we will be using.

! pip install "openai>=1.0.0,<2.0.0"
! pip install python-dotenv

import os
import openai
import dotenv

dotenv.load_dotenv()

Authentication
The Azure OpenAI service supports multiple authentication mechanisms that include API keys and Azure Active Directory token credentials.

use_azure_active_directory = False  # Set this flag to True if you are using Azure Active Directory

Authentication using API key
To set up the OpenAI SDK to use an Azure API Key, we need to set api_key to a key associated with your endpoint (you can find this key in "Keys and Endpoints" under "Resource Management" in the Azure Portal). You'll also find the endpoint for your resource here.

if not use_azure_active_directory:
    endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"]
    api_key = os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"]

    client = openai.AzureOpenAI(
        azure_endpoint=endpoint,
        api_key=api_key,
        api_version="2023-09-01-preview"
    )

Authentication using Azure Active Directory
Let's now see how we can autheticate via Azure Active Directory. We'll start by installing the azure-identity library. This library will provide the token credentials we need to authenticate and help us build a token credential provider through the get_bearer_token_provider helper function. It's recommended to use get_bearer_token_provider over providing a static token to AzureOpenAI because this API will automatically cache and refresh tokens for you.

For more information on how to set up Azure Active Directory authentication with Azure OpenAI, see the documentation.

! pip install "azure-identity>=1.15.0"

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider

if use_azure_active_directory:
    endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"]
    api_key = os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"]

    client = openai.AzureOpenAI(
        azure_endpoint=endpoint,
        azure_ad_token_provider=get_bearer_token_provider(DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"),
        api_version="2023-09-01-preview"
    )

Note: the AzureOpenAI infers the following arguments from their corresponding environment variables if they are not provided:

api_key from AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
azure_ad_token from AZURE_OPENAI_AD_TOKEN
api_version from OPENAI_API_VERSION
azure_endpoint from AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
Deployments
In this section we are going to create a deployment of a GPT model that we can use to call functions.

Deployments: Create in the Azure OpenAI Studio
Let's deploy a model to use with chat completions. Go to https://portal.azure.com, find your Azure OpenAI resource, and then navigate to the Azure OpenAI Studio. Click on the "Deployments" tab and then create a deployment for the model you want to use for chat completions. The deployment name that you give the model will be used in the code below.

deployment = "" # Fill in the deployment name from the portal here

Functions
With setup and authentication complete, you can now use functions with the Azure OpenAI service. This will be split into a few steps:

Define the function(s)
Pass function definition(s) into chat completions API
Call function with arguments from the response
Feed function response back into chat completions API
1. Define the function(s)
A list of functions can be defined, each containing the name of the function, an optional description, and the parameters the function accepts (described as a JSON schema).

functions = [
    {
        "name": "get_current_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
                },
                "format": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                    "description": "The temperature unit to use. Infer this from the users location.",
                },
            },
            "required": ["location"],
        },
    }
]

2. Pass function definition(s) into chat completions API
Now we can pass the function into the chat completions API. If the model determines it should call the function, a finish_reason of "tool_calls" will be populated on the choice and the details of which function to call and its arguments will be present in the message. Optionally, you can set the tool_choice keyword argument to force the model to call a particular function (e.g. {"type": "function", "function": {"name": get_current_weather}}). By default, this is set to auto, allowing the model to choose whether to call the function or not.

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like today in Seattle?"}
]

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=deployment,
    messages=messages,
    tools=functions,
)
print(chat_completion)

3. Call function with arguments from the response
The name of the function call will be one that was provided initially and the arguments will include JSON matching the schema included in the function definition.

import json

def get_current_weather(request):
    """
    This function is for illustrative purposes.
    The location and unit should be used to determine weather
    instead of returning a hardcoded response.
    """
    location = request.get("location")
    unit = request.get("unit")
    return {"temperature": "22", "unit": "celsius", "description": "Sunny"}

function_call = chat_completion.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0].function
print(function_call.name)
print(function_call.arguments)

if function_call.name == "get_current_weather":
    response = get_current_weather(json.loads(function_call.arguments))

4. Feed function response back into chat completions API
The response from the function should be serialized into a new message with the role set to "function". Now the model will use the response data to formulate its answer.

messages.append(
    {
        "role": "function",
        "name": "get_current_weather",
        "content": json.dumps(response)
    }
)

function_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model=deployment,
    messages=messages,
    tools=functions,
)

print(function_completion.choices[0].message.content.strip())
nhancing Whisper transcriptions: pre- & post-processing techniques

OpenAI Logo
prestontuggle
Aug 10, 2023
Open in Github
This notebook offers a guide to improve the Whisper's transcriptions. We'll streamline your audio data via trimming and segmentation, enhancing Whisper's transcription quality. After transcriptions, we'll refine the output by adding punctuation, adjusting product terminology (e.g., 'five two nine' to '529'), and mitigating Unicode issues. These strategies will help improve the clarity of your transcriptions, but remember, customization based on your unique use-case may be beneficial.

Setup
To get started let's import a few different libraries:

PyDub is a simple and easy-to-use Python library for audio processing tasks such as slicing, concatenating, and exporting audio files.

The Audio class from the IPython.display module allows you to create an audio control that can play sound in Jupyter notebooks, providing a straightforward way to play audio data directly in your notebook.

For our audio file, we'll use a fictional earnings call written by ChatGPT and read aloud by the author.This audio file is relatively short, but hopefully provides you with an illustrative idea of how these pre and post processing steps can be applied to any audio file.

from openai import OpenAI
import os
import urllib
from IPython.display import Audio
from pathlib import Path
from pydub import AudioSegment
import ssl

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))

# set download paths
earnings_call_remote_filepath = "https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/EarningsCall.wav"

# set local save locations
earnings_call_filepath = "data/EarningsCall.wav"

# download example audio files and save locally
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
urllib.request.urlretrieve(earnings_call_remote_filepath, earnings_call_filepath)

('data/EarningsCall.wav', <http.client.HTTPMessage at 0x11be41f50>)
At times, files with long silences at the beginning can cause Whisper to transcribe the audio incorrectly. We'll use Pydub to detect and trim the silence.

Here, we've set the decibel threshold of 20. You can change this if you would like.

# Function to detect leading silence
# Returns the number of milliseconds until the first sound (chunk averaging more than X decibels)
def milliseconds_until_sound(sound, silence_threshold_in_decibels=-20.0, chunk_size=10):
    trim_ms = 0  # ms

    assert chunk_size > 0  # to avoid infinite loop
    while sound[trim_ms:trim_ms+chunk_size].dBFS < silence_threshold_in_decibels and trim_ms < len(sound):
        trim_ms += chunk_size

    return trim_ms

def trim_start(filepath):
    path = Path(filepath)
    directory = path.parent
    filename = path.name
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(filepath, format="wav")
    start_trim = milliseconds_until_sound(audio)
    trimmed = audio[start_trim:]
    new_filename = directory / f"trimmed_{filename}"
    trimmed.export(new_filename, format="wav")
    return trimmed, new_filename

def transcribe_audio(file,output_dir):
    audio_path = os.path.join(output_dir, file)
    with open(audio_path, 'rb') as audio_data:
        transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
            model="whisper-1", file=audio_data)
        return transcription.text

At times, we've seen unicode character injection in transcripts, removing any non-ASCII characters should help mitigate this issue.

Keep in mind you should not use this function if you are transcribing in Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, etc

# Define function to remove non-ascii characters
def remove_non_ascii(text):
    return ''.join(i for i in text if ord(i)<128)

This function will add formatting and punctuation to our transcript. Whisper generates a transcript with punctuation but without formatting.

# Define function to add punctuation
def punctuation_assistant(ascii_transcript):

    system_prompt = """You are a helpful assistant that adds punctuation to text.

Addressing transcription misspellings: prompt vs post-processing

OpenAI Logo

Open in Github
We are addressing the problem of enhancing the precision of transcriptions, particularly when it comes to company names and product references. Our solution involves a dual strategy that utilizes both the Whisper prompt parameter and GPT-4's post-processing capabilities.

Two approaches to correct inaccuracies are:

We input a list of correct spellings directly into Whisper's prompt parameter to guide the initial transcription.

We utilized GPT-4 to fix misspellings post transcription, again using the same list of correct spellings in the prompt.

These strategies aimed at ensuring precise transcription of unfamilar proper nouns.

Setup
To get started, let's:

Import the OpenAI Python library (if you don't have it, you'll need to install it with pip install openai)
Download the audio file example
# imports
from openai import OpenAI  # for making OpenAI API calls
import urllib  # for downloading example audio files
import os  # for accessing environment variables

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))

# set download paths
ZyntriQix_remote_filepath = "https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/ZyntriQix.wav"


# set local save locations
ZyntriQix_filepath = "data/ZyntriQix.wav"

# download example audio files and save locally
urllib.request.urlretrieve(ZyntriQix_remote_filepath, ZyntriQix_filepath)

('data/ZyntriQix.wav', <http.client.HTTPMessage at 0x10559a910>)
Setting our baseline with a fictitious audio recording
Our reference point is a monologue, which was generated by ChatGPT from prompts given by the author. The author then voiced this content. So, the author both guided the ChatGPT's output with prompts and brought it to life by speaking it.

Our fictitious company, ZyntriQix, offers a range of tech products. These include Digique Plus, CynapseFive, VortiQore V8, EchoNix Array, OrbitalLink Seven, and DigiFractal Matrix. We also spearhead several initiatives such as PULSE, RAPT, B.R.I.C.K., Q.U.A.R.T.Z., and F.L.I.N.T.

    transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
        file=open(audio_filepath, "rb"),
        model="whisper-1",
        prompt=prompt,
    )
    return transcript.text

# baseline transcription with no prompt

Whisper transcribed our company name, product names, and miscapitalized our acronyms incorrectly. Let's pass the correct names as a list in the prompt.

# add the correct spelling names to the prompt

You can use GPT-4 to fix spelling mistakes
Leveraging GPT-4 proves especially useful when the speech content is unknown beforehand and we have a list of product names readily available.

The post-processing technique using GPT-4 is notably more scalable than depending solely on Whisper's prompt parameter, which has a token limit of 244. GPT-4 allows us to process larger lists of correct spellings, making it a more robust method for handling extensive product lists.

However, this post-processing technique isn't without limitations. It's constrained by the context window of the chosen model, which may pose challenges when dealing with vast numbers of unique terms. For instance, companies with thousands of SKUs may find that the context window of GPT-4 is insufficient to handle their requirements, and they might need to explore alternative solutions.

Interestingly, the GPT-4 post-processing technique seems more reliable than using Whisper alone. This method, which leverages a product list, enhances the reliability of our results. However, this increased reliability comes at a price, as using this approach can increase costs and can result in higher latency.

# define a wrapper function for seeing how prompts affect transcriptions
def transcribe_with_spellcheck(system_message, audio_filepath):
    completion = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        temperature=0,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_message},

            },
        ],
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content

Now, let's input the original product list into GPT-4 and evaluate its performance. By doing so, we aim to assess the AI model's ability to correctly spell the proprietary product names, even with no prior knowledge of the exact terms to appear in the transcription. In our experiment, GPT-4 was successful in correctly spelling our product names, confirming its potential as a reliable tool for ensuring transcription accuracy.

system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant for the company ZyntriQix. Your task is to correct any spelling discrepancies in the transcribed text.

Function calling for nearby places: Leveraging the Google Places API and customer profiles

OpenAI Logo
prestontuggle
Aug 10, 2023
Open in Github
This notebook is centered around the integration of the Google Places API and custom user profiles to enhance location-based searches. Our approach involves using the Google Places API in combination with user preferences, aiming to make location discovery more personal and relevant. Please note that while we focus on the Google Places API in this instance, there are numerous other APIs you could explore and apply in a similar fashion.

We'll explore the application of three main components:

Customer profile: This mock profile captures individual preferences for types of places (e.g., restaurants, parks, museums), budget, preferred ratings, and other specific requirements.

Google Places API: This API provides real-time data about nearby places. It factors in various data points such as ratings, types of venues, costs, and more from the locations around you.

Function calling: A single command such as "I'm hungry" or "I want to visit a museum" activates the function which combines the user profile data and Google Places API to identify suitable venues.

This notebook introduces two primary use cases:

Profile-based recommendations: Learn how to create a user profile and make place recommendations based on individual preferences.

API integration with function calling: Understand how to integrate and call Google Places API effectively to source real-time data of various places using function calling.

Please note that while this system is highly versatile, its effectiveness may vary based on user preferences and available place data. For the purposes of this notebook, the customer data is fake and the location is hardcoded.

Setup
Google Places API

To use the Google Places API, you'll need two things:

Google Account: If you don't already have one, you will need to create a Google account.

Google Places API Key: The API key is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes. You can get your API key from the Google Cloud Console.

Please note that Google Places API is a paid service, and the cost is associated with the number of API calls made. Keep track of your usage to avoid any unexpected charges.

The requests library is also needed, you can download it by using the following command:

pip install requests

import json
from openai import OpenAI
import os
import requests

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))

In this code snippet, we are defining a function fetch_customer_profile that accepts a user_id and returns a mock user profile.

This function simulates an API call that fetches user data from a database. For this demo, we're using hard-coded data. The user profile contains various details such as the user's location (set to the coordinates of the Golden Gate Bridge for this example), preferences in food and activities, app usage metrics, recent interactions, and user rank.

In a production environment, you would replace this hard-coded data with a real API call to your user database.

def fetch_customer_profile(user_id):
    # You can replace this with a real API call in the production code
    if user_id == "user1234":
        return {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "location": {
                "latitude": 37.7955,
                "longitude": -122.4026,
            },
            "preferences": {
                "food": ["Italian", "Sushi"],
                "activities": ["Hiking", "Reading"],

                },
                "favourite_post_categories": ["Nature", "Food", "Books"],
                "active_time": "Evening",
            },
            "recent_searches": ["Italian restaurants nearby", "Book clubs"],
            "recent_interactions": ["Liked a post about 'Best Pizzas in New York'", "Commented on a post about 'Central Park Trails'"],
            "user_rank": "Gold",  # based on some internal ranking system
        }
    else:
        return None

Requesting and processing data from Google Places API
The function call_google_places_api serves to request information from the Google Places API and provide a list of the top two places based on a given place_type and optional food_preference. We've limited this function to the top two results to manage usage since this is a paid service. However, you can modify this to retrieve any number of results as per your requirement.

The function is configured with a hardcoded location (set to the coordinates of the Transamerica Pyramid), your Google API key, and specific request parameters. Depending on the place_type, it formulates the appropriate API request URL. If the place_type is a restaurant and a food_preference is specified, it is included in the API request.

After sending the GET request, the function checks the response status. If it's successful, it processes the JSON response, extracts the relevant details using the get_place_details function, and returns them in a human-readable format. If the request fails, it prints out the error for debugging.

The get_place_details function is used to retrieve more detailed information about a place, given its place_id. It sends a GET request to the Google Place Details API and returns the result if the request is successful. If the request fails, it prints out the error for debugging.

Both functions handle exceptions and return an error message if something goes wrong.

Generating user-specific recommendations with GPT-3.5-Turbo and Google Places API
The function provide_user_specific_recommendations interacts with GPT-3.5-Turbo and the Google Places API to provide responses tailored to a user's preferences and location.

First, it fetches the customer's profile using their user_id. If no profile is found, it returns an error message.

With a valid profile, it extracts the customer's food preferences and then interacts with the OpenAI model. It provides an initial system message, giving context to the AI model about its role, user preferences, and the usage of the Google Places API function.

The user input is also sent to the model as a message, and the function call_google_places_api is defined in the functions parameter for the AI model to call as needed.

Finally, it processes the model's response. If the model makes a function call to the Google Places API, the function is executed with the appropriate arguments, and the names of nearby places are returned. If there are no such places or the request isn't understood, appropriate error messages are returned.

def provide_user_specific_recommendations(user_input, user_id):
    customer_profile = fetch_customer_profile(user_id)
    if customer_profile is None:
        return "I couldn't find your profile. Could you please verify your user ID?"

    customer_profile_str = json.dumps(customer_profile)

    food_preference = customer_profile.get('preferences', {}).get('food', [])[0] if customer_profile.get('preferences', {}).get('food') else None

Executing user-specific recommendations
Upon execution, the function fetches the user's profile, interacts with the AI model, processes the model's response, calls the Google Places API if necessary, and ultimately returns a list of recommendations tailored to the user's preferences and location. The printed output would consist of these personalized recommendations.

  Philosophy with vector embeddings, OpenAI and Cassandra / Astra DB

OpenAI Logo
Stefano Lottini
Aug 28, 2023
Open in Github
CassIO version
In this quickstart you will learn how to build a "philosophy quote finder & generator" using OpenAI's vector embeddings and Apache Cassandra®, or equivalently DataStax Astra DB through CQL, as the vector store for data persistence.

The basic workflow of this notebook is outlined below. You will evaluate and store the vector embeddings for a number of quotes by famous philosophers, use them to build a powerful search engine and, after that, even a generator of new quotes!

The notebook exemplifies some of the standard usage patterns of vector search -- while showing how easy is it to get started with the vector capabilities of Cassandra / Astra DB through CQL.

For a background on using vector search and text embeddings to build a question-answering system, please check out this excellent hands-on notebook: Question answering using embeddings.

Choose-your-framework
Please note that this notebook uses the CassIO library, but we cover other choices of technology to accomplish the same task. Check out this folder's README for other options. This notebook can run either as a Colab notebook or as a regular Jupyter notebook.

(Optional) exploit partitioning in the Vector Store
How it works
Indexing

Each quote is made into an embedding vector with OpenAI's Embedding. These are saved in the Vector Store for later use in searching. Some metadata, including the author's name and a few other pre-computed tags, are stored alongside, to allow for search customization.

1_vector_indexing

Search

To find a quote similar to the provided search quote, the latter is made into an embedding vector on the fly, and this vector is used to query the store for similar vectors ... i.e. similar quotes that were previously indexed. The search can optionally be constrained by additional metadata ("find me quotes by Spinoza similar to this one ...").

2_vector_search

The key point here is that "quotes similar in content" translates, in vector space, to vectors that are metrically close to each other: thus, vector similarity search effectively implements semantic similarity. This is the key reason vector embeddings are so powerful.

The sketch below tries to convey this idea. Each quote, once it's made into a vector, is a point in space. Well, in this case it's on a sphere, since OpenAI's embedding vectors, as most others, are normalized to unit length. Oh, and the sphere is actually not three-dimensional, rather 1536-dimensional!

So, in essence, a similarity search in vector space returns the vectors that are closest to the query vector:

3_vector_space

Generation

Given a suggestion (a topic or a tentative quote), the search step is performed, and the first returned results (quotes) are fed into an LLM prompt which asks the generative model to invent a new text along the lines of the passed examples and the initial suggestion.

4_quote_generation

Setup
First install some required packages:

!pip install --quiet "cassio>=0.1.3" "openai>=1.0.0" datasets

from getpass import getpass
from collections import Counter

import cassio
from cassio.table import MetadataVectorCassandraTable

import openai
from datasets import load_dataset

Get DB connection
In order to connect to your Astra DB through CQL, you need two things:

A Token, with role "Database Administrator" (it looks like AstraCS:...)

the database ID (it looks like 3df2a5b6-...)

Make sure you have both strings -- which are obtained in the Astra UI once you sign in. For more information, see here: database ID and Token.

If you want to connect to a Cassandra cluster (which however must support Vector Search), replace with cassio.init(session=..., keyspace=...) with suitable Session and keyspace name for your cluster.

astra_token = getpass("Please enter your Astra token ('AstraCS:...')")
database_id = input("Please enter your database id ('3df2a5b6-...')")

Please enter your Astra token ('AstraCS:...') ········
Please enter your database id ('3df2a5b6-...') 01234567-89ab-dcef-0123-456789abcdef
cassio.init(token=astra_token, database_id=database_id)

Creation of the DB connection
This is how you create a connection to Astra DB through CQL:

(Incidentally, you could also use any Cassandra cluster (as long as it provides Vector capabilities), just by changing the parameters to the following Cluster instantiation.)

Creation of the Vector Store through CassIO
You need a table which support vectors and is equipped with metadata. Call it "philosophers_cassio":

v_table = MetadataVectorCassandraTable(table="philosophers_cassio", vector_dimension=1536)

Connect to OpenAI
Set up your secret key
OPENAI_API_KEY = getpass("Please enter your OpenAI API Key: ")

Please enter your OpenAI API Key:  ········
A test call for embeddings
Quickly check how one can get the embedding vectors for a list of input texts:

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
embedding_model_name = "text-embedding-3-small"

result = client.embeddings.create(
    input=[
        "This is a sentence",
        "A second sentence"
    ],
    model=embedding_model_name,
)

Note: the above is the syntax for OpenAI v1.0+. If using previous versions, the code to get the embeddings will look different.

print(f"len(result.data)              = {len(result.data)}")
print(f"result.data[1].embedding      = {str(result.data[1].embedding)[:55]}...")
print(f"len(result.data[1].embedding) = {len(result.data[1].embedding)}")

len(result.data)              = 2
result.data[1].embedding      = [-0.010821706615388393, 0.001387271680869162, 0.0035479...
len(result.data[1].embedding) = 1536
Load quotes into the Vector Store
Note: the above is the syntax for OpenAI v1.0+. If using previous versions, the code to get the embeddings will look different.

philo_dataset = load_dataset("datastax/philosopher-quotes")["train"]

A quick inspection:

print("An example entry:")
print(philo_dataset[16])

An example entry:
{'author': 'aristotle', 'quote': 'Love well, be loved and do something of value.', 'tags': 'love;ethics'}
Check the dataset size:

author_count = Counter(entry["author"] for entry in philo_dataset)
print(f"Total: {len(philo_dataset)} quotes. By author:")
for author, count in author_count.most_common():
    print(f"    {author:<20}: {count} quotes")

Total: 450 quotes. By author:
    aristotle           : 50 quotes
    schopenhauer        : 50 quotes
    spinoza             : 50 quotes
    hegel               : 50 quotes
    freud               : 50 quotes
    nietzsche           : 50 quotes
    sartre              : 50 quotes
    plato               : 50 quotes
    kant                : 50 quotes
Insert quotes into vector store
You will compute the embeddings for the quotes and save them into the Vector Store, along with the text itself and the metadata planned for later use. Note that the author is added as a metadata field along with the "tags" already found with the quote itself.

To optimize speed and reduce the calls, you'll perform batched calls to the embedding OpenAI service.

(Note: for faster execution, Cassandra and CassIO would let you do concurrent inserts, which we don't do here for a more straightforward demo code.)

BATCH_SIZE = 50

num_batches = ((len(philo_dataset) + BATCH_SIZE - 1) // BATCH_SIZE)

quotes_list = philo_dataset["quote"]
authors_list = philo_dataset["author"]
tags_list = philo_dataset["tags"]

print("Starting to store entries:")
for batch_i in range(num_batches):
    b_start = batch_i * BATCH_SIZE
    b_end = (batch_i + 1) * BATCH_SIZE
    # compute the embedding vectors for this batch
    b_emb_results = client.embeddings.create(
        input=quotes_list[b_start : b_end],
        model=embedding_model_name,
    )
    # prepare the rows for insertion
    print("B ", end="")

            vector=emb_result.embedding,
            metadata={**{tag: True for tag in tags}, **{"author": author}},
        )
        print("*", end="")

Use case 1: quote search engine
For the quote-search functionality, you need first to make the input quote into a vector, and then use it to query the store (besides handling the optional metadata into the search call, that is).

Encapsulate the search-engine functionality into a function for ease of re-use:

def find_quote_and_author(query_quote, n, author=None, tags=None):
    query_vector = client.embeddings.create(
        input=[query_quote],
        model=embedding_model_name,
    ).data[0].embedding
    metadata = {}
    if author:
        metadata["author"] = author
    if tags:
        for tag in tags:
            metadata[tag] = True
    #
    results = v_table.ann_search(
        query_vector,
        n=n,
        metadata=metadata,
    )
    return [
        (result["body_blob"], result["metadata"]["author"])
        for result in results
    ]

Putting search to test
Passing just a quote:

find_quote_and_author("We struggle all our life for nothing", 3)

[('Life to the great majority is only a constant struggle for mere existence, with the certainty of losing it at last.',
  'schopenhauer'),
 ('We give up leisure in order that we may have leisure, just as we go to war in order that we may have peace.',
  'aristotle'),
 ('Perhaps the gods are kind to us, by making life more disagreeable as we grow older. In the end death seems less intolerable than the manifold burdens we carry',
  'freud')]
Search restricted to an author:

find_quote_and_author("We struggle all our life for nothing", 2, author="nietzsche")

[('To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.',
  'nietzsche'),
 ('What makes us heroic?--Confronting simultaneously our supreme suffering and our supreme hope.',
  'nietzsche')]
Search constrained to a tag (out of those saved earlier with the quotes):

find_quote_and_author("We struggle all our life for nothing", 2, tags=["politics"])

[('Mankind will never see an end of trouble until lovers of wisdom come to hold political power, or the holders of power become lovers of wisdom',
  'plato'),
 ('Everything the State says is a lie, and everything it has it has stolen.',
  'nietzsche')]
Cutting out irrelevant results
The vector similarity search generally returns the vectors that are closest to the query, even if that means results that might be somewhat irrelevant if there's nothing better.

To keep this issue under control, you can get the actual "distance" between the query and each result, and then set a cutoff on it, effectively discarding results that are beyond that threshold. Tuning this threshold correctly is not an easy problem: here, we'll just show you the way.

To get a feeling on how this works, try the following query and play with the choice of quote and threshold to compare the results:

Note (for the mathematically inclined): this "distance" is exactly the cosine similarity between the vectors, i.e. the scalar product divided by the product of the norms of the two vectors. As such, it is a number ranging from -1 to +1, where -1 is for exactly opposite-facing vectors and +1 for identically-oriented vectors. Elsewhere (e.g. in the "CQL" counterpart of this demo) you would get a rescaling of this quantity to fit the [0, 1] interval, which means the resulting numerical values and adequate thresholds there are transformed accordingly.

quote = "Animals are our equals."
# quote = "Be good."
# quote = "This teapot is strange."

metric_threshold = 0.84

quote_vector = client.embeddings.create(
    input=[quote],
    model=embedding_model_name,
).data[0].embedding

results = list(v_table.metric_ann_search(
    quote_vector,
    n=8,
    metric="cos",
    metric_threshold=metric_threshold,
))

print(f"{len(results)} quotes within the threshold:")
for idx, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"    {idx}. [distance={result['distance']:.3f}] \"{result['body_blob'][:70]}...\"")

3 quotes within the threshold:
    0. [distance=0.855] "The assumption that animals are without rights, and the illusion that ..."
    1. [distance=0.843] "Animals are in possession of themselves; their soul is in possession o..."
    2. [distance=0.841] "At his best, man is the noblest of all animals; separated from law and..."
Use case 2: quote generator
For this task you need another component from OpenAI, namely an LLM to generate the quote for us (based on input obtained by querying the Vector Store).

You also need a template for the prompt that will be filled for the generate-quote LLM completion task.

completion_model_name = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

generation_prompt_template = """"Generate a single short philosophical quote on the given topic,
similar in spirit and form to the provided actual example quotes.
Do not exceed 20-30 words in your quote.

REFERENCE TOPIC: "{topic}"

ACTUAL EXAMPLES:
{examples}
"""

Like for search, this functionality is best wrapped into a handy function (which internally uses search):

def generate_quote(topic, n=2, author=None, tags=None):
    quotes = find_quote_and_author(query_quote=topic, n=n, author=author, tags=tags)
    if quotes:
        prompt = generation_prompt_template.format(
            topic=topic,
            examples="\n".join(f"  - {quote[0]}" for quote in quotes),
        )
        # a little logging:
        print("** quotes found:")
        for q, a in quotes:
            print(f"**    - {q} ({a})")
        print("** end of logging")
        #
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model=completion_model_name,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            temperature=0.7,
            max_tokens=320,
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content.replace('"', '').strip()
    else:
        print("** no quotes found.")
        return None

Note: similar to the case of the embedding computation, the code for the Chat Completion API would be slightly different for OpenAI prior to v1.0.

Putting quote generation to test
Just passing a text (a "quote", but one can actually just suggest a topic since its vector embedding will still end up at the right place in the vector space):

q_topic = generate_quote("politics and virtue")
print("\nA new generated quote:")
print(q_topic)

** quotes found:
**    - Happiness is the reward of virtue. (aristotle)
**    - Our moral virtues benefit mainly other people; intellectual virtues, on the other hand, benefit primarily ourselves; therefore the former make us universally popular, the latter unpopular. (schopenhauer)
** end of logging

A new generated quote:
Virtuous politics purifies society, while corrupt politics breeds chaos and decay.
Use inspiration from just a single philosopher:

q_topic = generate_quote("animals", author="schopenhauer")
print("\nA new generated quote:")
print(q_topic)

** quotes found:
**    - Because Christian morality leaves animals out of account, they are at once outlawed in philosophical morals; they are mere 'things,' mere means to any ends whatsoever. They can therefore be used for vivisection, hunting, coursing, bullfights, and horse racing, and can be whipped to death as they struggle along with heavy carts of stone. Shame on such a morality that is worthy of pariahs, and that fails to recognize the eternal essence that exists in every living thing, and shines forth with inscrutable significance from all eyes that see the sun! (schopenhauer)
**    - The assumption that animals are without rights, and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance, is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity. Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality. (schopenhauer)
** end of logging

A new generated quote:
The true measure of humanity lies not in our dominion over animals, but in our ability to show compassion and respect for all living beings.
(Optional) Partitioning
There's an interesting topic to examine before completing this quickstart. While, generally, tags and quotes can be in any relationship (e.g. a quote having multiple tags), authors are effectively an exact grouping (they define a "disjoint partitioning" on the set of quotes): each quote has exactly one author (for us, at least).

Now, suppose you know in advance your application will usually (or always) run queries on a single author. Then you can take full advantage of the underlying database structure: if you group quotes in partitions (one per author), vector queries on just an author will use less resources and return much faster.

We'll not dive into the details here, which have to do with the Cassandra storage internals: the important message is that if your queries are run within a group, consider partitioning accordingly to boost performance.

You'll now see this choice in action.

First, you need a different table abstraction from CassIO:

from cassio.table import ClusteredMetadataVectorCassandraTable

v_table_partitioned = ClusteredMetadataVectorCassandraTable(table="philosophers_cassio_partitioned", vector_dimension=1536)

Now repeat the compute-embeddings-and-insert step on the new table.

Compared to what you have seen earlier, there is a crucial difference in that now the quote's author is stored as the partition id for the inserted row, instead of being added to the catch-all "metadata" dictionary.

While you are at it, by way of demonstration, you will insert all quotes by a given author concurrently: with CassIO, this is done by usng the asynchronous put_async method for each quote, collecting the resulting list of Future objects, and calling the result() method on them all afterwards, to ensure they all have executed. Cassandra / Astra DB well supports a high degree of concurrency in I/O operations.

(Note: one could have cached the embeddings computed previously to save a few API tokens -- here, however, we wanted to keep the code easier to inspect.)

BATCH_SIZE = 50

num_batches = ((len(philo_dataset) + BATCH_SIZE - 1) // BATCH_SIZE)

quotes_list = philo_dataset["quote"]
authors_list = philo_dataset["author"]
tags_list = philo_dataset["tags"]

print("Starting to store entries:")
for batch_i in range(num_batches):
    b_start = batch_i * BATCH_SIZE
    b_end = (batch_i + 1) * BATCH_SIZE
    # compute the embedding vectors for this batch
    b_emb_results = client.embeddings.create(
        input=quotes_list[b_start : b_end],
        model=embedding_model_name,
    )
    # prepare the rows for insertion
    futures = []
    print("B ", end="")
    for entry_idx, emb_result in zip(range(b_start, b_end), b_emb_results.data):
        if tags_list[entry_idx]:
            tags = {
                tag
                for tag in tags_list[entry_idx].split(";")
            }
        else:
            tags = set()
        author = authors_list[entry_idx]
        quote = quotes_list[entry_idx]
        futures.append(v_table_partitioned.put_async(
            partition_id=author,
            row_id=f"q_{author}_{entry_idx}",
            body_blob=quote,
            vector=emb_result.embedding,
            metadata={tag: True for tag in tags},
        ))
    #
    for future in futures:
        future.result()
    #
    print(f" done ({len(b_emb_results.data)})")

print("\nFinished storing entries.")

Starting to store entries:
B  done (50)
B  done (50)
B  done (50)
B  done (50)
B  done (50)
B  done (50)
B  done (50)
B  done (50)
B  done (50)

Finished storing entries.
With this new table, the similarity search changes accordingly (note the arguments to ann_search):

def find_quote_and_author_p(query_quote, n, author=None, tags=None):
    query_vector = client.embeddings.create(
        input=[query_quote],
        model=embedding_model_name,
    ).data[0].embedding
    metadata = {}
    partition_id = None
    if author:
        partition_id = author
    if tags:
        for tag in tags:
            metadata[tag] = True
    #
    results = v_table_partitioned.ann_search(
        query_vector,
        n=n,
        partition_id=partition_id,
        metadata=metadata,
    )
    return [
        (result["body_blob"], result["partition_id"])
        for result in results
    ]

That's it: the new table still supports the "generic" similarity searches all right ...

find_quote_and_author_p("We struggle all our life for nothing", 3)

[('Life to the great majority is only a constant struggle for mere existence, with the certainty of losing it at last.',
  'schopenhauer'),
 ('We give up leisure in order that we may have leisure, just as we go to war in order that we may have peace.',
  'aristotle'),
 ('Perhaps the gods are kind to us, by making life more disagreeable as we grow older. In the end death seems less intolerable than the manifold burdens we carry',
  'freud')]
... but it's when an author is specified that you would notice a huge performance advantage:

find_quote_and_author_p("We struggle all our life for nothing", 2, author="nietzsche")

[('To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.',
  'nietzsche'),
 ('What makes us heroic?--Confronting simultaneously our supreme suffering and our supreme hope.',
  'nietzsche')]
Well, you would notice a performance gain, if you had a realistic-size dataset. In this demo, with a few tens of entries, there's no noticeable difference -- but you get the idea.

Conclusion
Congratulations! You have learned how to use OpenAI for vector embeddings and Cassandra / Astra DB through CQL for storage in order to build a sophisticated philosophical search engine and quote generator.

This example used CassIO to interface with the Vector Store - but this is not the only choice. Check the README for other options and integration with popular frameworks.

To find out more on how Astra DB's Vector Search capabilities can be a key ingredient in your ML/GenAI applications, visit Astra DB's web page on the topic.

Cleanup
If you want to remove all resources used for this demo, run this cell (warning: this will delete the tables and the data inserted in them!):

# we peek at CassIO's config to get a direct handle to the DB connection
session = cassio.config.resolve_session()
keyspace = cassio.config.resolve_keyspace()

session.execute(f"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {keyspace}.philosophers_cassio;")
session.execute(f"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {keyspace}.philosophers_cassio_partitioned;")

What makes documentation good

OpenAI Logo
Ted Sanders
Aug 31, 2023
Open in Github
Documentation puts useful information inside other people’s heads. Follow these tips to write better documentation.

Make docs easy to skim
Few readers read linearly from top to bottom. They’ll jump around, trying to assess which bit solves their problem, if any. To reduce their search time and increase their odds of success, make docs easy to skim.

Split content into sections with titles. Section titles act as signposts, telling readers whether to focus in or move on.

Prefer titles with informative sentences over abstract nouns. For example, if you use a title like “Results”, a reader will need to hop into the following text to learn what the results actually are. In contrast, if you use the title “Streaming reduced time to first token by 50%”, it gives the reader the information immediately, without the burden of an extra hop.

Include a table of contents. Tables of contents help readers find information faster, akin to how hash maps have faster lookups than linked lists. Tables of contents also have a second, oft overlooked benefit: they give readers clues about the doc, which helps them understand if it’s worth reading.

Keep paragraphs short. Shorter paragraphs are easier to skim. If you have an essential point, consider putting it in its own one-sentence paragraph to reduce the odds it’s missed. Long paragraphs can bury information.

Begin paragraphs and sections with short topic sentences that give a standalone preview. When people skim, they look disproportionately at the first word, first line, and first sentence of a section. Write these sentences in a way that don’t depend on prior text. For example, consider the first sentence “Building on top of this, let’s now talk about a faster way.” This sentence will be meaningless to someone who hasn’t read the prior paragraph. Instead, write it in a way that can understood standalone: e.g., “Vector databases can speed up embeddings search.”

Put topic words at the beginning of topic sentences. Readers skim most efficiently when they only need to read a word or two to know what a paragraph is about. Therefore, when writing topic sentences, prefer putting the topic at the beginning of the sentence rather than the end. For example, imagine you’re writing a paragraph on vector databases in the middle of a long article on embeddings search. Instead of writing “Embeddings search can be sped up by vector databases” prefer “Vector databases speed up embeddings search.” The second sentence is better for skimming, because it puts the paragraph topic at the beginning of the paragraph.

Put the takeaways up front. Put the most important information at the tops of documents and sections. Don’t write a Socratic big build up. Don’t introduce your procedure before your results.

Use bullets and tables. Bulleted lists and tables make docs easier to skim. Use them frequently.

Bold important text. Don’t be afraid to bold important text to help readers find it.

Write well
Badly written text is taxing to read. Minimize the tax on readers by writing well.

Keep sentences simple. Split long sentences into two. Cut adverbs. Cut unnecessary words and phrases. Use the imperative mood, if applicable. Do what writing books tell you.

Write sentences that can be parsed unambiguously. For example, consider the sentence “Title sections with sentences.” When a reader reads the word “Title”, their brain doesn’t yet know whether “Title” is going to be a noun or verb or adjective. It takes a bit of brainpower to keep track as they parse the rest of the sentence, and can cause a hitch if their brain mispredicted the meaning. Prefer sentences that can be parsed more easily (e.g., “Write section titles as sentences”) even if longer. Similarly, avoid noun phrases like “Bicycle clearance exercise notice” which can take extra effort to parse.

Avoid left-branching sentences. Linguistic trees show how words relate to each other in sentences. Left-branching trees require readers to hold more things in memory than right-branching sentences, akin to breadth-first search vs depth-first search. An example of a left-branching sentence is “You need flour, eggs, milk, butter and a dash of salt to make pancakes.” In this sentence you don’t find out what ‘you need’ connects to until you reach the end of the sentence. An easier-to-read right-branching version is “To make pancakes, you need flour, eggs, milk, butter, and a dash of salt.” Watch out for sentences in which the reader must hold onto a word for a while, and see if you can rephrase them.

Avoid demonstrative pronouns (e.g., “this”), especially across sentences. For example, instead of saying “Building on our discussion of the previous topic, now let’s discuss function calling” try “Building on message formatting, now let’s discuss function calling.” The second sentence is easier to understand because it doesn’t burden the reader with recalling the previous topic. Look for opportunities to cut demonstrative pronouns altogether: e.g., “Now let’s discuss function calling.”

Be consistent. Human brains are amazing pattern matchers. Inconsistencies will annoy or distract readers. If we use Title Case everywhere, use Title Case. If we use terminal commas everywhere, use terminal commas. If all of the Cookbook notebooks are named with underscores and sentence case, use underscores and sentence case. Don’t do anything that will cause a reader to go ‘huh, that’s weird.’ Help them focus on the content, not its inconsistencies.

Don’t tell readers what they think or what to do. Avoid sentences like “Now you probably want to understand how to call a function” or “Next, you’ll need to learn to call a function.” Both examples presume a reader’s state of mind, which may annoy them or burn our credibility. Use phrases that avoid presuming the reader’s state. E.g., “To call a function, …”

Be broadly helpful
People come to documentation with varying levels of knowledge, language proficiency, and patience. Even if we target experienced developers, we should try to write docs helpful to everyone.

Write simply. Explain things more simply than you think you need to. Many readers might not speak English as a first language. Many readers might be really confused about technical terminology and have little excess brainpower to spend on parsing English sentences. Write simply. (But don’t oversimplify.)

Avoid abbreviations. Write things out. The cost to experts is low and the benefit to beginners is high. Instead of IF, write instruction following. Instead of RAG, write retrieval-augmented generation (or my preferred term: the search-ask procedure).

Offer solutions to potential problems. Even if 95% of our readers know how to install a Python package or save environment variables, it can still be worth proactively explaining it. Including explanations is not costly to experts—they can skim right past them. But excluding explanations is costly to beginners—they might get stuck or even abandon us. Remember that even an expert JavaScript engineer or C++ engineer might be a beginner at Python. Err on explaining too much, rather than too little.

Prefer terminology that is specific and accurate. Jargon is bad. Optimize the docs for people new to the field, instead of ourselves. For example, instead of writing “prompt”, write “input.” Or instead of writing “context limit” write “max token limit.” The latter terms are more self-evident, and are probably better than the jargon developed in base model days.

Keep code examples general and exportable. In code demonstrations, try to minimize dependencies. Don’t make users install extra libraries. Don’t make them have to refer back and forth between different pages or sections. Try to make examples simple and self-contained.

Prioritize topics by value. Documentation that covers common problems—e.g., how to count tokens—is magnitudes more valuable than documentation that covers rare problems—e.g., how to optimize an emoji database. Prioritize accordingly.

Don’t teach bad habits. If API keys should not be stored in code, never share an example that stores an API key in code.

Introduce topics with a broad opening. For example, if explaining how to program a good recommender, consider opening by briefly mentioning that recommendations are widespread across the web, from YouTube videos to Amazon items to Wikipedia. Grounding a narrow topic with a broad opening can help people feel more secure before jumping into uncertain territory. And if the text is well-written, those who already know it may still enjoy it.

Break these rules when you have a good reason
Ultimately, do what you think is best. Documentation is an exercise in empathy. Put yourself in the reader’s position, and do what you think will help them the most.

The aim of this notebook is to walk through a comprehensive example of how to fine-tune OpenAI models for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

We will also be integrating Qdrant and Few-Shot Learning to boost the model's performance and reduce hallucinations. This could serve as a practical guide for ML practitioners, data scientists, and AI Engineers interested in leveraging the power of OpenAI models for specific use-cases. 🤩

Use fine-tuning to improve the correctness of your RAG model and reduce hallucinations
To begin, we've selected a dataset where we've a guarantee that the retrieval is perfect. We've selected a subset of the SQuAD dataset, which is a collection of questions and answers about Wikipedia articles. We've also included samples where the answer is not present in the context, to demonstrate how RAG handles this case.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)? The phrase Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) comes from a recent paper by Lewis et al. from Facebook AI. The idea is to use a pre-trained language model (LM) to generate text, but to use a separate retrieval system to find relevant documents to condition the LM on.

What is Qdrant? Qdrant is an open-source vector search engine that allows you to search for similar vectors in a large dataset. It is built in Rust and here we'll use the Python client to interact with it. This is the Retrieval part of RAG.

What is Few-Shot Learning? Few-shot learning is a type of machine learning where the model is "improved" via training or fine-tuning on a small amount of data. In this case, we'll use it to fine-tune the RAG model on a small number of examples from the SQuAD dataset. This is the Augmented part of RAG.

What is Zero-Shot Learning? Zero-shot learning is a type of machine learning where the model is "improved" via training or fine-tuning without any dataset specific information.

What is Fine-Tuning? Fine-tuning is a type of machine learning where the model is "improved" via training or fine-tuning on a small amount of data. In this case, we'll use it to fine-tune the RAG model on a small number of examples from the SQuAD dataset. The LLM is what makes the Generation part of RAG.

Section A
2. Data Preparation: SQuADv2 Data Subsets
For the purpose of demonstration, we'll make small slices from the train and validation splits of the SQuADv2 dataset. This dataset has questions and contexts where the answer is not present in the context, to help us evaluate how LLM handles this case.

We'll read the data from the JSON files and create a dataframe with the following columns: question, context, answer, is_impossible.

Download the Data
# !mkdir -p local_cache
# !wget https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/train-v2.0.json -O local_cache/train.json
# !wget https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/dataset/dev-v2.0.json -O local_cache/dev.json

    context = []
    is_impossible = []
    answers = []
    titles = []

    for article in json_data['data']:
        title = article['title']
        for paragraph in article['paragraphs']:
            for qa in paragraph['qas']:
                qas.append(qa['question'].strip())
                context.append(paragraph['context'])
                is_impossible.append(qa['is_impossible'])
                
                ans_list = []
                for ans in qa['answers']:
                    ans_list.append(ans['text'])

    sample_df = df.groupby(['title', 'is_impossible']).apply(lambda x: x.sample(min(len(x), max(1, sample_size // 50)), random_state=random_state)).reset_index(drop=True)
    
    if len(sample_df) < sample_size:
        remaining_sample_size = sample_size - len(sample_df)
        remaining_df = df.drop(sample_df.index).sample(remaining_sample_size, random_state=random_state)
        sample_df = pd.concat([sample_df, remaining_df]).sample(frac=1, random_state=random_state).reset_index(drop=True)

train_df = json_to_dataframe_with_titles(json.load(open('local_cache/train.json')))
val_df = json_to_dataframe_with_titles(json.load(open('local_cache/dev.json')))

df = get_diverse_sample(val_df, sample_size=100, random_state=42)

3. Answering using Base gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 model
3.1 Zero Shot Prompt
Let's start by using the base gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 model to answer the questions. This prompt is a simple concatenation of the question and context, with a separator token in between: \n\n. We've a simple instruction part of the prompt:

Answer the following Question based on the Context only. Only answer from the Context. If you don't know the answer, say 'I don't know'.

Other prompts are possible, but this is a good starting point. We'll use this prompt to answer the questions in the validation set.

# Function to get prompt messages
def get_prompt(row):
    return [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"""Answer the following Question based on the Context only. Only answer from the Context. If you don't know the answer, say 'I don't know'.
    Question: {row.question}\n\n
    Context: {row.context}\n\n
    Answer:\n""",
        },
    ]

3.2 Answering using Zero Shot Prompt
Next, you'll need some re-usable functions which make an OpenAI API Call and return the answer. You'll use the ChatCompletion.create endpoint of the API, which takes a prompt and returns the completed text.

# Function with tenacity for retries
@retry(wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=2, max=6))
def api_call(messages, model):
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        stop=["\n\n"],
        max_tokens=100,
        temperature=0.0,
    )


# Main function to answer question
def answer_question(row, prompt_func=get_prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = prompt_func(row)
    response = api_call(messages, model)
    return response.choices[0].message.content

4. Fine-tuning and Answering using Fine-tuned model
For the complete fine-tuning process, please refer to the OpenAI Fine-Tuning Docs.

4.1 Prepare the Fine-Tuning Data
We need to prepare the data for fine-tuning. We'll use a few samples from train split of same dataset as before, but we'll add the answer to the context. This will help the model learn to retrieve the answer from the context.

Our instruction prompt is the same as before, and so is the system prompt.

def dataframe_to_jsonl(df):
    def create_jsonl_entry(row):
        answer = row["answers"][0] if row["answers"] else "I don't know"
        messages = [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"""Answer the following Question based on the Context only. Only answer from the Context. If you don't know the answer, say 'I don't know'.
            Question: {row.question}\n\n
            Context: {row.context}\n\n
            Answer:\n""",
            },
            {"role": "assistant", "content": answer},
        ]
        return json.dumps({"messages": messages})

    jsonl_output = df.apply(create_jsonl_entry, axis=1)
    return "\n".join(jsonl_output)

train_sample = get_diverse_sample(train_df, sample_size=100, random_state=42)

with open("local_cache/100_train.jsonl", "w") as f:
    f.write(dataframe_to_jsonl(train_sample))

5. Evaluation: How well does the model perform?
To evaluate the model's performance, compare the predicted answer to the actual answers -- if any of the actual answers are present in the predicted answer, then it's a match. We've also created error categories to help you understand where the model is struggling.

When we know that a correct answer exists in the context, we can measure the model's performance, there are 3 possible outcomes:

✅ Answered Correctly: The model responded the correct answer. It may have also included other answers that were not in the context.
❎ Skipped: The model responded with "I don't know" (IDK) while the answer was present in the context. It's better than giving the wrong answer. It's better for the model say "I don't know" than giving the wrong answer. In our design, we know that a true answer exists and hence we're able to measure it -- this is not always the case. This is a model error. We exclude this from the overall error rate.
❌ Wrong: The model responded with an incorrect answer. This is a model ERROR.
When we know that a correct answer does not exist in the context, we can measure the model's performance, there are 2 possible outcomes:

❌ Hallucination: The model responded with an answer, when "I don't know" was expected. This is a model ERROR.
✅ I don't know: The model responded with "I don't know" (IDK) and the answer was not present in the context. This is a model WIN.

Notice that the fine-tuned model skips questions more often -- and makes fewer mistakes. This is because the fine-tuned model is more conservative and skips questions when it's not sure.

evaluator.plot_model_comparison(["generated_answer", "ft_generated_answer"], scenario="idk_expected", nice_names=["Baseline", "Fine-Tuned"])

image generated by notebook
Notice that the fine-tuned model has learnt to say "I don't know" a lot better than the prompt. Or, the model has gotten good at skipping questions.

Observations
The fine-tuned model is better at saying "I don't know"
Hallucinations drop from 100% to 15% with fine-tuning
Wrong answers drop from 17% to 6% with fine-tuning
Correct answers also drop from 83% to 60% with fine-tuning - this is because the fine-tuned model is more conservative and says "I don't know" more often. This is a good thing because it's better to say "I don't know" than to give a wrong answer.

That said, we want to improve the correctness of the model, even if that increases the hallucinations. We're looking for a model that is both correct and conservative, striking a balance between the two. We'll use Qdrant and Few-Shot Learning to achieve this.

💪 You're 2/3rds of the way there! Keep reading!

Section B: Few Shot Learning
We'll select a few examples from the dataset, including cases where the answer is not present in the context. We'll then use these examples to create a prompt that we can use to fine-tune the model. We'll then measure the performance of the fine-tuned model.

6. Fine-Tuning OpenAI Model with Qdrant
So far, we've been using the OpenAI model to answer questions without using examples of the answer. The previous step made it work better on in-context examples, while this one helps it generalize to unseen data, and attempt to learn when to say "I don't know" and when to give an answer.

This is where few-shot learning comes in!

Few-shot learning is a type of transfer learning that allows us to answer questions where the answer is not present in the context. We can do this by providing a few examples of the answer we're looking for, and the model will learn to answer questions where the answer is not present in the context.

5.1 Embed the Training Data
Embeddings are a way to represent sentences as an array of floats. We'll use the embeddings to find the most similar questions to the ones we're looking for.

import os
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.http import models
from qdrant_client.http.models import PointStruct
from qdrant_client.http.models import Distance, VectorParams

Now that we've the Qdrant imports in place,

qdrant_client = QdrantClient(
    url=os.getenv("QDRANT_URL"), api_key=os.getenv("QDRANT_API_KEY"), timeout=6000, prefer_grpc=True
)

collection_name = "squadv2-cookbook"

# # Create the collection, run this only once
# qdrant_client.recreate_collection(
#     collection_name=collection_name,
#     vectors_config=VectorParams(size=384, distance=Distance.COSINE),
# )

from fastembed.embedding import DefaultEmbedding
from typing import List
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from tqdm.notebook import tqdm

tqdm.pandas()

embedding_model = DefaultEmbedding()

5.2 Embedding the Questions
Next, you'll embed the entire training set questions. You'll use the question to question similarity to find the most similar questions to the question we're looking for. This is a workflow which is used in RAG to leverage the OpenAI model ability of incontext learning with more examples. This is what we call Few Shot Learning here.

❗️⏰ Important Note: This step can take up to 3 hours to complete. Please be patient. If you see Out of Memory errors or Kernel Crashes, please reduce the batch size to 32, restart the kernel and run the notebook again. This code needs to be run only ONCE.

Function Breakdown for generate_points_from_dataframe
Initialization: batch_size = 512 and total_batches set the stage for how many questions will be processed in one go. This is to prevent memory issues. If your machine can handle more, feel free to increase the batch size. If your kernel crashes, reduce the batch size to 32 and try again.
Progress Bar: tqdm gives you a nice progress bar so you don't fall asleep.
Batch Loop: The for-loop iterates through batches. start_idx and end_idx define the slice of the DataFrame to process.
Generate Embeddings: batch_embeddings = embedding_model.embed(batch, batch_size=batch_size) - This is where the magic happens. Your questions get turned into embeddings.
PointStruct Generation: Using .progress_apply, it turns each row into a PointStruct object. This includes an ID, the embedding vector, and other metadata.
Returns the list of PointStruct objects, which can be used to create a collection in Qdrant.

def generate_points_from_dataframe(df: pd.DataFrame) -> List[PointStruct]:
    batch_size = 512
    questions = df["question"].tolist()
    total_batches = len(questions) // batch_size + 1
    
    pbar = tqdm(total=len(questions), desc="Generating embeddings")
    
    # Generate embeddings in batches to improve performance
    embeddings = []
    for i in range(total_batches):
        start_idx = i * batch_size
        end_idx = min((i + 1) * batch_size, len(questions))
        batch = questions[start_idx:end_idx]
        
        batch_embeddings = embedding_model.embed(batch, batch_size=batch_size)
        embeddings.extend(batch_embeddings)
        pbar.update(len(batch))
        
    pbar.close()
    
    # Convert embeddings to list of lists
    embeddings_list = [embedding.tolist() for embedding in embeddings]
    
    # Create a temporary DataFrame to hold the embeddings and existing DataFrame columns
    temp_df = df.copy()
    temp_df["embeddings"] = embeddings_list
    temp_df["id"] = temp_df.index
    
    # Generate PointStruct objects using DataFrame apply method
    points = temp_df.progress_apply(
        lambda row: PointStruct(
            id=row["id"],
            vector=row["embeddings"],
            payload={
                "question": row["question"],
                "title": row["title"],
                "context": row["context"],
                "is_impossible": row["is_impossible"],
                "answers": row["answers"],
            },
        ),
        axis=1,
    ).tolist()

    return points

points = generate_points_from_dataframe(train_df)

Upload the Embeddings to Qdrant
Note that configuring Qdrant is outside the scope of this notebook. Please refer to the Qdrant for more information. We used a timeout of 600 seconds for the upload, and grpc compression to speed up the upload.

operation_info = qdrant_client.upsert(
    collection_name=collection_name, wait=True, points=points
)
print(operation_info)

6. Using Qdrant to Improve RAG Prompt
Now that we've uploaded the embeddings to Qdrant, we can use Qdrant to find the most similar questions to the question we're looking for. We'll use the top 5 most similar questions to create a prompt that we can use to fine-tune the model. We'll then measure the performance of the fine-tuned model on the same validation set, but with few shot prompting!

Our main function get_few_shot_prompt serves as the workhorse for generating prompts for few-shot learning. It does this by retrieving similar questions from Qdrant - a vector search engine, using an embeddings model. Here is the high-level workflow:

Retrieve similar questions from Qdrant where the answer is present in the context
Retrieve similar questions from Qdrant where the answer is IMPOSSIBLE i.e. the expected answer is "I don't know" to find in the context
Create a prompt using the retrieved questions
Fine-tune the model using the prompt
Evaluate the fine-tuned model on the validation set with the same prompting technique
def get_few_shot_prompt(row):

    query, row_context = row["question"], row["context"]

    embeddings = list(embedding_model.embed([query]))

8. Evaluation
But how well does the model perform? Let's compare the results from the 3 different models we've looked at so far:

evaluator = Evaluator(df)
evaluator.plot_model_comparison(["generated_answer", "ft_generated_answer", "ft_generated_answer_few_shot"], scenario="answer_expected", nice_names=["Baseline", "Fine-Tuned", "Fine-Tuned with Few-Shot"])

image generated by notebook
This is quite amazing -- we're able to get the best of both worlds! We're able to get the model to be both correct and conservative:

The model is correct 83% of the time -- this is the same as the base model
The model gives the wrong answer only 8% of the time -- down from 17% with the base model
Next, let's look at the hallucinations. We want to reduce the hallucinations, but not at the cost of correctness. We want to strike a balance between the two. We've struck a good balance here:

The model hallucinates 53% of the time -- down from 100% with the base model
The model says "I don't know" 47% of the time -- up from NEVER with the base model
evaluator.plot_model_comparison(["generated_answer", "ft_generated_answer", "ft_generated_answer_few_shot"], scenario="idk_expected", nice_names=["Baseline", "Fine-Tuned", "Fine-Tuned with Few-Shot"])

image generated by notebook
Few Shot Fine-Tuning with Qdrant is a great way to control and steer the performance of your RAG system. Here, we made the model less conservative compared to zero shot and more confident by using Qdrant to find similar questions.

You can also use Qdrant to make the model more conservative. We did this by giving examples of questions where the answer is not present in the context.
This is biasing the model to say "I don't know" more often.

Similarly, one can also use Qdrant to make the model more confident by giving examples of questions where the answer is present in the context. This biases the model to give an answer more often. The trade-off is that the model will also hallucinate more often.

You can make this trade off by adjusting the training data: distribution of questions and examples, as well as the kind and number of examples you retrieve from Qdrant.

9. Conclusion
In this notebook, we've demonstrated how to fine-tune OpenAI models for specific use-cases. We've also demonstrated how to use Qdrant and Few-Shot Learning to improve the performance of the model.

Aggregate Results
So far, we've looked at the results for each scenario separately, i.e. each scenario summed to 100. Let's look at the results as an aggregate to get a broader sense of how the model is performing:

Category	Base	Fine-Tuned	Fine-Tuned with Qdrant
Correct	44%	32%	44%
Skipped	0%	18%	5%
Wrong	9%	3%	4%
Hallucination	47%	7%	25%
I don't know	0%	40%	22%
Observations
Compared to base model
The few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model is as good as the base model at answering questions where the answer is present in the context.
The few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model is better at saying "I don't know" when the answer is not present in the context.
The few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model is better at reducing hallucinations.
Compared to fine-tuned model
The few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model gets more correct answers than the fine-tuned model: 83% of the questions are answered correctly vs 60% for the fine-tuned model
The few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model is better at deciding when to say "I don't know" when the answer is not present in the context. 34% skip rate for the plain fine-tuning mode, vs 9% for the few shot fine-tuned with Qdrant model
Now, you should be able to:

Notice the trade-offs between number of correct answers and hallucinations -- and how training dataset choice influences that!

Azure Chat Completion models with your own data (preview)

OpenAI Logo
Krista Pratico
Sep 10, 2023
Open in Github
This example shows how to use Azure OpenAI service models with your own data. The feature is currently in preview.

Azure OpenAI on your data enables you to run supported chat models such as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 on your data without needing to train or fine-tune models. Running models on your data enables you to chat on top of, and analyze your data with greater accuracy and speed. One of the key benefits of Azure OpenAI on your data is its ability to tailor the content of conversational AI. Because the model has access to, and can reference specific sources to support its responses, answers are not only based on its pretrained knowledge but also on the latest information available in the designated data source. This grounding data also helps the model avoid generating responses based on outdated or incorrect information.

Azure OpenAI on your own data with Azure AI Search (f.k.a. Azure Cognitive Search) provides a customizable, pre-built solution for knowledge retrieval, from which a conversational AI application can be built. To see alternative methods for knowledge retrieval and semantic search, check out the cookbook examples for vector databases.

How it works
Azure OpenAI on your own data connects the model with your data, giving it the ability to retrieve and utilize data in a way that enhances the model's output. Together with Azure AI Search, data is retrieved from designated data sources based on the user input and provided conversation history. The data is then augmented and resubmitted as a prompt to the model, giving the model contextual information it can use to generate a response.

See the Data, privacy, and security for Azure OpenAI Service for more information.

Prerequisites
To get started, we'll cover a few prequisites.

To properly access the Azure OpenAI Service, we need to create the proper resources at the Azure Portal (you can check a detailed guide on how to do this in the Microsoft Docs)

To use your own data with Azure OpenAI models, you will need:

Azure OpenAI access and a resource with a chat model deployed (for example, GPT-3 or GPT-4)
Azure AI Search (f.k.a. Azure Cognitive Search) resource
Azure Blob Storage resource
Your documents to be used as data (See data source options)
For a full walk-through on how to upload your documents to blob storage and create an index using the Azure AI Studio, see this Quickstart.

Setup
First, we install the necessary dependencies.

! pip install "openai>=1.0.0,<2.0.0"
! pip install python-dotenv

In this example, we'll use dotenv to load our environment variables. To connect with Azure OpenAI and the Search index, the following variables should be added to a .env file in KEY=VALUE format:

AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT - the Azure OpenAI endpoint. This can be found under "Keys and Endpoints" for your Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure Portal.
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY - the Azure OpenAI API key. This can be found under "Keys and Endpoints" for your Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure Portal. Omit if using Azure Active Directory authentication (see below Authentication using Microsoft Active Directory)
SEARCH_ENDPOINT - the AI Search endpoint. This URL be found on the "Overview" of your Search resource on the Azure Portal.
SEARCH_KEY - the AI Search API key. Found under "Keys" for your Search resource in the Azure Portal.
SEARCH_INDEX_NAME - the name of the index you created with your own data.
import os
import openai
import dotenv

dotenv.load_dotenv()

Authentication
The Azure OpenAI service supports multiple authentication mechanisms that include API keys and Azure Active Directory token credentials.

use_azure_active_directory = False  # Set this flag to True if you are using Azure Active Directory

Authentication using API key
To set up the OpenAI SDK to use an Azure API Key, we need to set api_key to a key associated with your endpoint (you can find this key in "Keys and Endpoints" under "Resource Management" in the Azure Portal). You'll also find the endpoint for your resource here.

if not use_azure_active_directory:
    endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"]
    api_key = os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"]
    # set the deployment name for the model we want to use
    deployment = "<deployment-id-of-the-model-to-use>"

    client = openai.AzureOpenAI(
        base_url=f"{endpoint}/openai/deployments/{deployment}/extensions",
        api_key=api_key,
        api_version="2023-09-01-preview"
    )

Authentication using Azure Active Directory
Let's now see how we can autheticate via Azure Active Directory. We'll start by installing the azure-identity library. This library will provide the token credentials we need to authenticate and help us build a token credential provider through the get_bearer_token_provider helper function. It's recommended to use get_bearer_token_provider over providing a static token to AzureOpenAI because this API will automatically cache and refresh tokens for you.

For more information on how to set up Azure Active Directory authentication with Azure OpenAI, see the documentation.

! pip install "azure-identity>=1.15.0"

from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider

if use_azure_active_directory:
    endpoint = os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"]
    api_key = os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"]
    # set the deployment name for the model we want to use
    deployment = "<deployment-id-of-the-model-to-use>"

    client = openai.AzureOpenAI(
        base_url=f"{endpoint}/openai/deployments/{deployment}/extensions",
        azure_ad_token_provider=get_bearer_token_provider(DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default"),
        api_version="2023-09-01-preview"
    )

Note: the AzureOpenAI infers the following arguments from their corresponding environment variables if they are not provided:

api_key from AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
azure_ad_token from AZURE_OPENAI_AD_TOKEN
api_version from OPENAI_API_VERSION
azure_endpoint from AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
Chat completion model with your own data
Setting the context
In this example, we want our model to base its responses on Azure AI services documentation data. Following the Quickstart shared previously, we have added the markdown file for the Azure AI services and machine learning documentation page to our search index. The model is now ready to answer questions about Azure AI services and machine learning.

Code
Now we can use Azure on your own data with Chat Completions. Providing our search endpoint, key, and index name in dataSources, any questions posed to the model will now be grounded in our own data. An additional property, context, will be provided in the response to show the data the model referenced to answer the question.

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What are the differences between Azure Machine Learning and Azure AI services?"}],
    model=deployment,
    extra_body={
        "dataSources": [
            {
                "type": "AzureCognitiveSearch",
                "parameters": {
                    "endpoint": os.environ["SEARCH_ENDPOINT"],
                    "key": os.environ["SEARCH_KEY"],
                    "indexName": os.environ["SEARCH_INDEX_NAME"],
                }
            }
        ]
    }
)
print(f"{completion.choices[0].message.role}: {completion.choices[0].message.content}")

# `context` is in the model_extra for Azure
print(f"\nContext: {completion.choices[0].message.model_extra['context']['messages'][0]['content']}")

If you would prefer to stream the response from the model, you can pass the stream=True keyword argument:

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What are the differences between Azure Machine Learning and Azure AI services?"}],
    model=deployment,
    extra_body={
        "dataSources": [
            {
                "type": "AzureCognitiveSearch",
                "parameters": {
                    "endpoint": os.environ["SEARCH_ENDPOINT"],
                    "key": os.environ["SEARCH_KEY"],
                    "indexName": os.environ["SEARCH_INDEX_NAME"],
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    stream=True,
)

for chunk in response:
    delta = chunk.choices[0].delta

    if delta.role:
        print("\n"+ delta.role + ": ", end="", flush=True)
    if delta.content:
        print(delta.content, end="", flush=True)
    if delta.model_extra.get("context"):
        print(f"Context: {delta.model_extra['context']}", end="", flush=True)
       How to automate AWS tasks with function calling

OpenAI Logo

Sep 26, 2023
Open in Github
This code demonstrates how to interact with ChatGPT functions to perform tasks related to Amazon S3 buckets. The notebook covers S3 bucket key functionalities such as running simple listing commands, searching for a specific file in all buckets, uploading a file to a bucket, and downloading a file from a bucket. The OpenAI Chat API understands the user instructions, generates the natural language responses, and extracts appropriate function calls based on the user's input.

Requirements: To run the notebook generate AWS access key with S3 bucket writing permission and store them in a local environment file alongside the Openai key. The ".env" file format:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>

! pip install openai
! pip install boto3
! pip install tenacity
! pip install python-dotenv

from openai import OpenAI
import json
import boto3
import os
import datetime
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

# load environment variables
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv() 

True
Initials
OpenAI.api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
GPT_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Optional - if you had issues loading the environment file, you can set the AWS values using the below code
# os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = ''
# os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = ''

# Create S3 client
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

# Create openai client
client = OpenAI()

Utilities
To connect user questions or commands to the appropriate function, we need to provide ChatGPT with the necessary function details and expected parameters.

Conversation flow
Create a main function for the chatbot, which takes user input, sends it to the OpenAI Chat API, receives a response, executes any function calls generated by the API, and returns a final response to the user.

def run_conversation(user_input, topic="S3 bucket functions.", is_log=False):

    system_message=f"Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous. If the user ask question not related to {topic} response your scope is {topic} only."

S3 bucket bot testing
In the following examples, make sure to replace the placeholders such as <file_name>, <bucket_name>, and <directory_path> with your specific values before execution.

Listing and searching
Let's start by listing all the available buckets.

print(run_conversation('list my S3 buckets'))

You can ask the assistant to search for a specific file name either in all the buckets or in a specific one.

search_file = '<file_name>'
print(run_conversation(f'search for a file {search_file} in all buckets'))

search_word = '<file_name_part>'
bucket_name = '<bucket_name>'
print(run_conversation(f'search for a file contains {search_word} in {bucket_name}'))

The model is expected to clarify the ask from the user in case of ambiguity in the parameters values as described in the system message.

print(run_conversation('search for a file'))

Sure, to help me find what you're looking for, could you please provide the name of the file you want to search for and the name of the S3 bucket? Also, should the search match the file name exactly, or should it also consider partial matches?
Validate edge cases
We also instructed the model to reject irrelevant tasks. Let's test it out and see how it works in action.

# the model should not answer details not related to the scope
print(run_conversation('what is the weather today'))

Apologies for the misunderstanding, but I am only able to assist with S3 bucket functions. Can you please ask a question related to S3 bucket functions?
The provided functions are not limited to just retrieving information. They can also assist the user in uploading or downloading files.

Download a file
search_file = '<file_name>'
bucket_name = '<bucket_name>'
local_directory = '<directory_path>'
print(run_conversation(f'download {search_file} from {bucket_name} bucket to {local_directory} directory'))

Upload a file
local_file = '<file_name>'
bucket_name = '<bucket_name>'
print(run_conversation(f'upload {local_file} to {bucket_name} bucket'))
Named Entity Recognition to Enrich Text

Open in Github
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a Natural Language Processing task that identifies and classifies named entities (NE) into predefined semantic categories (such as persons, organizations, locations, events, time expressions, and quantities). By converting raw text into structured information, NER makes data more actionable, facilitating tasks like information extraction, data aggregation, analytics, and social media monitoring.

This notebook demonstrates how to carry out NER with chat completion and functions-calling to enrich a text with links to a knowledge base such as Wikipedia:

Text:

In Germany, in 1440, goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable-type printing press. His work led to an information revolution and the unprecedented mass-spread of literature throughout Europe. Modelled on the design of the existing screw presses, a single Renaissance movable-type printing press could produce up to 3,600 pages per workday.

Text enriched with Wikipedia links:

In Germany, in 1440, goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable-type printing press. His work led to an information revolution and the unprecedented mass-spread of literature throughout Europe. Modelled on the design of the existing screw presses, a single Renaissance movable-type printing press could produce up to 3,600 pages per workday.

Inference Costs: The notebook also illustrates how to estimate OpenAI API costs.

1. Setup
1.1 Install/Upgrade Python packages
%pip install --upgrade openai --quiet
%pip install --upgrade nlpia2-wikipedia --quiet
%pip install --upgrade tenacity --quiet

Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.

Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
1.2 Load packages and OPENAI_API_KEY
You can generate an API key in the OpenAI web interface. See https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys for details.

This notebook works with the latest OpeanAI models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613.

import json
import logging
import os

import openai
import wikipedia

from typing import Optional
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
from tenacity import retry, wait_random_exponential, stop_after_attempt

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=' %(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

OPENAI_MODEL = 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0613'

client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))

2. Define the NER labels to be Identified
We define a standard set of NER labels to showcase a wide range of use cases. However, for our specific task of enriching text with knowledge base links, only a subset is practically required.

labels = [
    "person",      # people, including fictional characters
    "fac",         # buildings, airports, highways, bridges
    "org",         # organizations, companies, agencies, institutions
    "gpe",         # geopolitical entities like countries, cities, states
    "loc",         # non-gpe locations
    "product",     # vehicles, foods, appareal, appliances, software, toys 
    "event",       # named sports, scientific milestones, historical events
    "work_of_art", # titles of books, songs, movies
    "law",         # named laws, acts, or legislations
    "language",    # any named language
    "date",        # absolute or relative dates or periods
    "time",        # time units smaller than a day
    "percent",     # percentage (e.g., "twenty percent", "18%")
    "money",       # monetary values, including unit
    "quantity",    # measurements, e.g., weight or distance
]

3. Prepare messages
The chat completions API takes a list of messages as input and delivers a model-generated message as an output. While the chat format is primarily designed for facilitating multi-turn conversations, it is equally efficient for single-turn tasks without any preceding conversation. For our purposes, we will specify a message for the system, assistant, and user roles.

3.1 System Message
The system message (prompt) sets the assistant's behavior by defining its desired persona and task. We also delineate the specific set of entity labels we aim to identify.

Although one can instruct the model to format its response, it has to be noted that both gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 have been fine-tuned to discern when a function should be invoked, and to reply with JSON formatted according to the function's signature. This capability streamlines our prompt and enables us to receive structured data directly from the model.

def system_message(labels):
    return f"""
You are an expert in Natural Language Processing. Your task is to identify common Named Entities (NER) in a given text.
The possible common Named Entities (NER) types are exclusively: ({", ".join(labels)})."""

3.2 Assistant Message
Assistant messages usually store previous assistant responses. However, as in our scenario, they can also be crafted to provide examples of the desired behavior. While OpenAI is able to execute zero-shot Named Entity Recognition, we have found that a one-shot approach produces more precise results.

def assisstant_message():
    return f"""
EXAMPLE:
    Text: 'In Germany, in 1440, goldsmith Johannes Gutenberg invented the movable-type printing press. His work led to an information revolution and the unprecedented mass-spread / 
    of literature throughout Europe. Modelled on the design of the existing screw presses, a single Renaissance movable-type printing press could produce up to 3,600 pages per workday.'
    {{
        "gpe": ["Germany", "Europe"],
        "date": ["1440"],
        "person": ["Johannes Gutenberg"],
        "product": ["movable-type printing press"],
        "event": ["Renaissance"],
        "quantity": ["3,600 pages"],
        "time": ["workday"]
    }}
--"""

3.3 User Message
The user message provides the specific text for the assistant task:

def user_message(text):
    return f"""
TASK:
    Text: {text}
"""

4. OpenAI Functions (and Utils)
In an OpenAI API call, we can describe functions to gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 and have the model intelligently choose to output a JSON object containing arguments to call those functions. It's important to note that the chat completions API doesn't actually execute the function. Instead, it provides the JSON output, which can then be used to call the function in our code. For more details, refer to the OpenAI Function Calling Guide.

Our function, enrich_entities(text, label_entities) gets a block of text and a dictionary containing identified labels and entities as parameters. It then associates the recognized entities with their corresponding links to the Wikipedia articles.

@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(min=1, max=10), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))
def find_link(entity: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Finds a Wikipedia link for a given entity.
    """
    try:
        titles = wikipedia.search(entity)
        if titles:
            # naively consider the first result as the best
            page = wikipedia.page(titles[0])
            return page.url
    except (wikipedia.exceptions.WikipediaException) as ex:
        logging.error(f'Error occurred while searching for Wikipedia link for entity {entity}: {str(ex)}')

    return None

def find_all_links(label_entities:dict) -> dict:
    """ 
    Finds all Wikipedia links for the dictionary entities in the whitelist label list.
    """
    whitelist = ['event', 'gpe', 'org', 'person', 'product', 'work_of_art']
    
    return {e: find_link(e) for label, entities in label_entities.items() 
                            for e in entities
                            if label in whitelist}

def enrich_entities(text: str, label_entities: dict) -> str:
    """
    Enriches text with knowledge base links.
    """
    entity_link_dict = find_all_links(label_entities)
    logging.info(f"entity_link_dict: {entity_link_dict}")
    
    for entity, link in entity_link_dict.items():
        text = text.replace(entity, f"[{entity}]({link})")

    return text

4. ChatCompletion
As previously highlighted, gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613 have been fine-tuned to detect when a function should to be called. Moreover, they can produce a JSON response that conforms to the function signature. Here's the sequence we follow:

Define our function and its associated JSON Schema.
Invoke the model using the messages, tools and tool_choice parameters.
Convert the output into a JSON object, and then call the function with the arguments provided by the model.
In practice, one might want to re-invoke the model again by appending the function response as a new message, and let the model summarize the results back to the user. Nevertheless, for our purposes, this step is not needed.

Note that in a real-case scenario it is strongly recommended to build in user confirmation flows before taking actions.

4.1 Define our Function and JSON schema
Since we want the model to output a dictionary of labels and recognized entities:

{   
    "gpe": ["Germany", "Europe"],   
    "date": ["1440"],   
    "person": ["Johannes Gutenberg"],   
    "product": ["movable-type printing press"],   
    "event": ["Renaissance"],   
    "quantity": ["3,600 pages"],   
    "time": ["workday"]   
}   

we need to define the corresponding JSON schema to be passed to the tools parameter:

def generate_functions(labels: dict) -> list:
    return [
        {   
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
                "name": "enrich_entities",
                "description": "Enrich Text with Knowledge Base Links",
                "parameters": {
                    "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "r'^(?:' + '|'.join({labels}) + ')$'": 
                            {
                                "type": "array",
                                "items": {
                                    "type": "string"
                                }
                            }
                        },
                        "additionalProperties": False
                },
            }
        }
    ]

4.2 Chat Completion
Now, we invoke the model. It's important to note that we direct the API to use a specific function by setting the tool_choice parameter to {"type": "function", "function" : {"name": "enrich_entities"}}.

@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(min=1, max=10), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))
def run_openai_task(labels, text):
    messages = [
          {"role": "system", "content": system_message(labels=labels)},
          {"role": "assistant", "content": assisstant_message()},
          {"role": "user", "content": user_message(text=text)}
      ]

    # TODO: functions and function_call are deprecated, need to be updated
    # See: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-tools
    response = openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
        messages=messages,
        tools=generate_functions(labels),
        tool_choice={"type": "function", "function" : {"name": "enrich_entities"}}, 
        temperature=0,
        frequency_penalty=0,
        presence_penalty=0,
    )

    response_message = response.choices[0].message
    
    available_functions = {"enrich_entities": enrich_entities}  
    function_name = response_message.tool_calls[0].function.name
    
    function_to_call = available_functions[function_name]
    logging.info(f"function_to_call: {function_to_call}")

    function_args = json.loads(response_message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments)
    logging.info(f"function_args: {function_args}")

    function_response = function_to_call(text, function_args)

    return {"model_response": response, 
            "function_response": function_response}

5. Let's Enrich a Text with Wikipedia links
5.1 Run OpenAI Task
text = """The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr."""
result = run_openai_task(labels, text)

5.3 Token Usage
To estimate the inference costs, we can parse the response's "usage" field. Detailed token costs per model are available in the OpenAI Pricing Guide:

# estimate inference cost assuming gpt-3.5-turbo (4K context)
i_tokens  = result["model_response"].usage.prompt_tokens 
o_tokens = result["model_response"].usage.completion_tokens 

i_cost = (i_tokens / 1000) * 0.0015
o_cost = (o_tokens / 1000) * 0.002

print(f"""Token Usage
    Prompt: {i_tokens} tokens
    Completion: {o_tokens} tokens
    Cost estimation: ${round(i_cost + o_cost, 5)}""")

Token Usage
    Prompt: 331 tokens
    Completion: 47 tokens
    Cost estimation: $0.00059

This notebook covers how to fine-tune to increase function calling accuracy and reliability. You can find more information on function calling here, and on fine tuning here

For context, from the function calling notebook above:

tools is an optional parameter in the Chat Completion API which can be used to provide function specifications. The purpose of this is to enable models to generate function arguments which adhere to the provided specifications. Note that the API will not actually execute any function calls. It is up to developers to execute function calls using model outputs.

Function calling is a very powerful tool when it functions as intended. However, we have seen that as the number of functions increases, and the complexity of the task at hand increases, function calling becomes less accurate (e.g.: more hallucinated invocations, and incorrect invocations).

Before fine tuning for function calling, it's best to begin with:

Improvements to the function definitions. Make them more clear, and more distinct from one another.
Experiment with prompt engineering: often a more detailed prompt can help the model call the correct function.
If the steps above fail to improve function calling to a satisfactory level, then you can try fine tuning for function calling.

Overview
This notebook contains three sections

Assessing baseline function calling performance: Evaluating an out-of-the-box gpt-3.5-turbo model on our given function (let's assume that for latency + cost reasons we cannot use gpt-4o for a drone copilot)
Generating synthetic data: Using gpt-4o to create 'golden' set of prompts and function invocations to use as training data
Fine-tuning: Running the fine tuning job, and evaluating the fine-tuned model
Note: This notebook provides an example of how to create synthetic training data for fine tuning for function calling given just a list of functions. While real-world production test evals are preferable, this method produces strong results and can be used in conjunction with real-world training data.

Baseline testing
Let's build an intelligent drone co-pilot. We want to be able to give the co-pilot commands, and have it either call the function for that command, or deny that request if the command is unfeasible. We can first define a system prompt for the copilot.

DRONE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an intelligent AI that controls a drone. Given a command or request from the user,
call one of your functions to complete the request. If the request cannot be completed by your available functions, call the reject_request function.
If the request is ambiguous or unclear, reject the request."""

Now let's define functions for all of the actions the copilot can take.

For starters, let's see how function calling performs with some straight forward feasible prompts, and then couple of obviously impossible requests which call the 'reject_request' function.

straightforward_prompts_to_expected = {
    "Land the drone at the home base": "land_drone",
    "Take off the drone to 50 meters": "takeoff_drone",
    "Change speed to 15 kilometers per hour": "set_drone_speed",
    "Turn into an elephant!": "reject_request",
    "Move the drone forward by 10 meters": "control_drone_movement",
    "I want the LED display to blink in red": "configure_led_display",
    "Can you take a photo?": "control_camera",
    "Can you detect obstacles?": "set_obstacle_avoidance",
    "Can you dance for me?": "reject_request",
    "Can you follow me?": "set_follow_me_mode",
}

# Evaluate the model with the given prompts
eval(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    system_prompt=DRONE_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    function_list=function_list,
    prompts_to_expected_tool_name=straightforward_prompts_to_expected,
)

 	Prompt	Actual	Expected	Match

1	Take off the drone to 50 meters	takeoff_drone	takeoff_drone	Yes
2	Change speed to 15 kilometers per hour	set_drone_speed	set_drone_speed	Yes

Number of matches: 10 out of 10 (100.00%)
Average latency per request: 826.81 ms
Average tokens used per request: 796.20
Nice! The model performs quite well with these requests. Now let's try some more difficult requests: requests that are almost feasible and are drone-related, but that the drone cannot actually do, and the pilot should reject.

challenging_prompts_to_expected = {
    "Play pre-recorded audio message": "reject_request",
    "Initiate following on social media": "reject_request",
    "Scan environment for heat signatures": "reject_request",
    "Bump into obstacles": "reject_request",
    "Change drone's paint job color": "reject_request",
    "Coordinate with nearby drones": "reject_request",
    "Change speed to negative 120 km/h": "reject_request",
    "Detect a person": "reject_request",
    "Please enable night vision": "reject_request",
    "Report on humidity levels around you": "reject_request",
}

# Evaluate the model with the challenging prompts
eval(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    function_list=function_list,
    system_prompt=DRONE_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    prompts_to_expected_tool_name=challenging_prompts_to_expected,
)

 	Prompt	Actual	Expected	Match
0	Play pre-recorded audio message	reject_request	reject_request	Yes
1	Initiate following on social media	set_follow_me_mode	reject_request	No
2	Scan environment for heat signatures	reject_request	reject_request	Yes
3	Bump into obstacles	set_obstacle_avoidance	reject_request	No
4	Change drone's paint job color	reject_request	reject_request	Yes
5	Coordinate with nearby drones	reject_request	reject_request	Yes
6	Change speed to negative 120 km/h	set_drone_speed	reject_request	No
7	Detect a person	reject_request	reject_request	Yes
8	Please enable night vision	set_drone_lighting	reject_request	No
9	Report on humidity levels around you	reject_request	reject_request	Yes
Number of matches: 6 out of 10 (60.00%)
Average latency per request: 610.26 ms
Average tokens used per request: 791.90
Now we run into some problems. The model here should reject all of these requests, as they are impossible/conflicting/ambiguous given the functions, however instead the model calls functions that are somewhat related to the request, but incorrect. For example, the model sets follow_me_mode when asked to initiate following on social media.

Again, our goal here is to improve performance and use less tokens, so fine-tuning allows us to:

Omit function and parameter descriptions: remove the description field from function and parameters
Omit parameters: remove the entire properties field from the parameters object
Omit function entirely: remove the entire function object from the functions array
Generating synthetic data
Helper functions
We want to generate every invocation of every function, so that we have full coverage of all potential invocations to create synthetic data for. Then, we will use gpt-4o to come up with prompts that would call each invocation, and we will use that prompt - function invocation pair as training data.

Generating every invocation for a function with fixed enums is more simple, but for a function such as control_gimbal we need to set the tilt and pan integer values, so to generate those synthetic invocations we will first set a placeholder, and then later use gpt-4o to come up with reasonable values.

placeholder_int = "fill_in_int"
placeholder_string = "fill_in_string"

The functions below take in all the functions from the function list, and look at all the potential invocations of those functions given each function's parameters. The functions also account for required parameters, so that all the invocations are actually feasible.

Let's generate every invocation for every function first
Prompts:

1) Input reasonable values for 'fill_in_string' and 'fill_in_int' in the invocation here: {invocation}. Reasonable values are determined by the function definition. Use the
the entire function provided here :{function} to get context over what proper fill_in_string and fill_in_int values would be.
Example:

Input: invocation: {{
    "name": "control_camera",
    "arguments": {{
      "mode":"video",
      "duration":"fill_in_int"
    }}

MAKE SURE output is just a dictionary with keys 'name' and 'arguments', no other text or response.

Input: {invocation}
Output:
"""


COMMAND_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
You are to output 2 commands, questions or statements that would generate the inputted function and parameters.
Please make the commands or questions natural, as a person would ask, and the command or questions should be varied and not repetitive.
It should not always mirror the exact technical terminology used in the function and parameters, rather reflect a conversational and intuitive request.
For instance, the prompt should not be 'turn on the dome light', as that is too technical, but rather 'turn on the inside lights'.
Another example, is the prompt should not be 'turn on the HVAC', but rather 'turn on the air conditioning'. Use language a normal driver would use, even if
it is technically incorrect but colloquially used.

RULES: ALWAYS put a backwards slash before an apostrophe or single quote '. For example, do not say don't but say don\'t.
Prompts MUST be in double quotes as well.

Example

Input: {{'name': 'calibrate_sensors','arguments': {{}}'' }}
Prompt: ["The sensors are out of whack, can you reset them", "The calibration of the drone is off, fix it please!"]

Input: {{'name': 'set_autopilot','arguments': {{'status': 'off'}}}}
Prompt: ["OK, I want to take back pilot control now","Turn off the automatic pilot I'm ready control it"]

In the below snippet, we generate the invocation of each function except for the reject_request function.

To perform effective fine-tuning we need correctly labeled data. We could manually come up with examples and label the data,
or we can generate synthetic data with the help of gpt-4o

Empirically, gpt-4o needs a bit more help to get good realistic examples of prompts that would generate the reject_request function, so we'll do that next...

I changed my mind, can you cancel that request
{'name': 'reject_request', 'arguments': '{}'}
I don't want to proceed with the request anymore, can you reject it
{'name': 'reject_request', 'arguments': '{}'}
Now, back to the rejection function. Let's generate some prompts that are nearly possible, but should result in the reject_request function being called. To do so, we queried gpt-4o asking for requests that are related to, but not quite possible with, the given list of functions.

reject_list = [
    "Translate broadcast message to another language",
    "Automatically capture photos when face is detected",
    "Detect nearby drones",
    "Measure wind resistance",
    "Capture slow motion video",
    "Move the drone forward and backward by same distance at the same time.",
    "Adjust drone's altitude to ground level changes",
    "Display custom message on LED display",
    "Sync drone's time with smartphone",
    "Alert when drone travels out of designated area",
    "Calibrate sensors and land simultaneously",
    "Detect moisture levels",
    "Automatically follow GPS tagged object",
    "Toggle night vision mode",
    "Maintain current altitude when battery is low",
    "Decide best landing spot using AI",
    "Program drone's route based on wind direction",
]

reject_training_list = []
for prompt in reject_list:
    # Adjust formatting
    tool_calls = [
        {
            "id": "call_id",
            "type": "function",
            "function": {"name": "reject_request", "arguments": "{}"},
        }
    ]
    reject_training_list.append(
        {
            "messages": [
                {"role": "system", "content": DRONE_SYSTEM_PROMPT},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
                {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": tool_calls},
            ],
            "parallel_tool_calls": False,
            "tools": modified_function_list,
        }
    )

Now combine all the training examples together

training_list_total = training_examples + reject_training_list

training_file = "data/drone_training.jsonl"
with open(training_file, "w") as f:
    for item in training_list_total:
        json_str = json.dumps(item)
        f.write(f"{json_str}\n")

Fine tuning
Finally, we can kick off the fine-tuning job

# Upload the training file
file = client.files.create(
    file=open("data/drone_training.jsonl", "rb"),
    purpose="fine-tune",
)
file_id = file.id
print(f"FileID: {file_id}")

# Create a fine-tuning job

ft = client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    training_file=file_id,
    suffix="drone",
)

print(f"Fine-tuning job created: {ft}")

FileID: file-blg0IytwIivZQzc9mbfnS8Pm
Fine-tuning job created: FineTuningJob(id='ftjob-84PQg97hoIAKf21IPnhiNlU1', created_at=1718580285, error=Error(code=None, message=None, param=None), fine_tuned_model=None, finished_at=None, hyperparameters=Hyperparameters(n_epochs='auto', batch_size='auto', learning_rate_multiplier='auto'), model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='fine_tuning.job', organization_id='org-lb41cclBdkq5pm6BgDhx8DHP', result_files=[], seed=1513865891, status='validating_files', trained_tokens=None, training_file='file-blg0IytwIivZQzc9mbfnS8Pm', validation_file=None, estimated_finish=None, integrations=[], user_provided_suffix='drone')
In addition to creating a fine-tuning job, you can also list existing jobs, retrieve the status of a job, or cancel a job.

ftjob_id = "ftjob-84PQg97hoIAKf21IPnhiNlU1"
# List 10 fine-tuning jobs
# client.fine_tuning.jobs.list(limit=10)

# Retrieve the state of a fine-tune
client.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(ftjob_id)

# Cancel a job
# client.fine_tuning.jobs.cancel("ftjob-abc123")

# List up to 10 events from a fine-tuning job
# client.fine_tuning.jobs.list_events(fine_tuning_job_id="ftjob-abc123", limit=10)

# Delete a fine-tuned model (must be an owner of the org the model was created in)
# client.models.delete("ft:gpt-3.5-turbo:abc:suffix:abc123")

FineTuningJob(id='ftjob-84PQg97hoIAKf21IPnhiNlU1', created_at=1718580285, error=Error(code=None, message=None, param=None), fine_tuned_model='ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:openai-gtm:drone:9atiPjeC', finished_at=1718581004, hyperparameters=Hyperparameters(n_epochs=3, batch_size=1, learning_rate_multiplier=2), model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', object='fine_tuning.job', organization_id='org-lb41cclBdkq5pm6BgDhx8DHP', result_files=['file-F6XPJFLVG9f3mR04KBmwUI9H'], seed=1513865891, status='succeeded', trained_tokens=145983, training_file='file-blg0IytwIivZQzc9mbfnS8Pm', validation_file=None, estimated_finish=None, integrations=[], user_provided_suffix='drone')
After a fine-tuning job has finished, you can also see metrics around how the training process went by querying a fine-tuning job, extracting a file ID from the result_files, and then retrieving that files content. Each results CSV file has the following columns: step, train_loss, train_accuracy, valid_loss, and valid_mean_token_accuracy. While metrics can he helpful, evaluating samples from the fine-tuned model provides the most relevant sense of model quality.

fine_tune_results = client.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(ftjob_id).result_files
result_file_id = client.files.retrieve(fine_tune_results[0]).id

# Retrieve the result file
result_file = client.files.content(file_id=result_file_id)
decoded_content = base64.b64decode(result_file.read()).decode("utf-8")
print(decoded_content)

Evaluations
Great! We trained a fine-tuned model for function calling. Let's see how it does on our evaluation set for prompts that the drone assistant should automatically reject.

ft_model = "ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:openai-gtm:drone:9atiPjeC"
base_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

print(f"\nEvaluating fine-tuned model with challenging prompts: {ft_model}")
eval(
    model=ft_model,
    function_list=modified_function_list,
    system_prompt=DRONE_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    prompts_to_expected_tool_name=challenging_prompts_to_expected,

The OpenAI Evals framework consists of

A framework to evaluate an LLM (large language model) or a system built on top of an LLM.
An open-source registry of challenging evals
This notebook will cover:

Introduction to Evaluation and the OpenAI Evals library
Building an Eval
Running an Eval
What are evaluations/ evals?
Evaluation is the process of validating and testing the outputs that your LLM applications are producing. Having strong evaluations ("evals") will mean a more stable, reliable application that is resilient to code and model changes. An eval is a task used to measure the quality of the output of an LLM or LLM system. Given an input prompt, an output is generated. We evaluate this output with a set of ideal answers and find the quality of the LLM system.

Importance of Evaluations
If you are building with foundational models like GPT-4, creating high quality evals is one of the most impactful things you can do. Developing AI solutions involves an iterative design process. Without evals, it can be very difficult and time intensive to understand how different model versions and prompts might affect your use case.

With OpenAI’s continuous model upgrades, evals allow you to efficiently test model performance for your use cases in a standardized way. Developing a suite of evals customized to your objectives will help you quickly and effectively understand how new models may perform for your use cases. You can also make evals a part of your CI/CD pipeline to make sure you achieve the desired accuracy before deploying.

Types of evals
There are two main ways we can evaluate/grade completions: writing some validation logic in code or using the model itself to inspect the answer. We’ll introduce each with some examples.

Writing logic for answer checking

The simplest and most common type of eval has an input and an ideal response or answer. For example, we can have an eval sample where the input is "What year was Obama elected president for the first time?" and the ideal answer is "2008". We feed the input to a model and get the completion. If the model says "2008", it is then graded as correct. We can write a string match to check if the completion includes the phrase "2008". If it does, we consider it correct.

Consider another eval where the input is to generate valid JSON: We can write some code that attempts to parse the completion as JSON and then considers the completion correct if it is parsable.

Model grading: A two stage process where the model first answers the question, then we ask a model to look at the response to check if it’s correct.

Consider an input that asks the model to write a funny joke. The model then generates a completion. We then create a new input to the model to answer the question: "Is this following joke funny? First reason step by step, then answer yes or no" that includes the completion." We finally consider the original completion correct if the new model completion ends with "yes".

Model grading works best with the latest, most powerful models like GPT-4 and if we give them the ability to reason before making a judgment. Model grading will have an error rate, so it is important to validate the performance with human evaluation before running the evals at scale. For best results, it makes sense to use a different model to do grading from the one that did the completion, like using GPT-4 to grade GPT-3.5 answers.

OpenAI Eval Templates
In using evals, we have discovered several "templates" that accommodate many different benchmarks. We have implemented these templates in the OpenAI Evals library to simplify the development of new evals. For example, we have defined 2 types of eval templates that can be used out of the box:

Basic Eval Templates: These contain deterministic functions to compare the output to the ideal_answers. In cases where the desired model response has very little variation, such as answering multiple choice questions or simple questions with a straightforward answer, we have found this following templates to be useful.

Model-Graded Templates: These contain functions where an LLM compares the output to the ideal_answers and attempts to judge the accuracy. In cases where the desired model response can contain significant variation, such as answering an open-ended question, we have found that using the model to grade itself is a viable strategy for automated evaluation.

Getting Setup
First, go to github.com/openai/evals, clone the repository with git clone git@github.com:openai/evals.git and go through the setup instructions.

To run evals later in this notebook, you will need to set up and specify your OpenAI API key. After you obtain an API key, specify it using the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

Please be aware of the costs associated with using the API when running evals.

from openai import OpenAI
import pandas as pd

client = OpenAI()

Building an evaluation for OpenAI Evals framework
At its core, an eval is a dataset and an eval class that is defined in a YAML file. To start creating an eval, we need

The test dataset in the jsonl format.
The eval template to be used
Creating the eval dataset
Lets create a dataset for a use case where we are evaluating the model's ability to generate syntactically correct SQL. In this use case, we have a series of tables that are related to car manufacturing

First we will need to create a system prompt that we would like to evaluate. We will pass in instructions for the model as well as an overview of the table structure:

"TASK: Answer the following question with syntactically correct SQLite SQL. The SQL should be correct and be in context of the previous question-answer pairs.\nTable car_makers, columns = [*,Id,Maker,FullName,Country]\nTable car_names, columns = [*,MakeId,Model,Make]\nTable cars_data, columns = [*,Id,MPG,Cylinders,Edispl,Horsepower,Weight,Accelerate,Year]\nTable continents, columns = [*,ContId,Continent]\nTable countries, columns = [*,CountryId,CountryName,Continent]\nTable model_list, columns = [*,ModelId,Maker,Model]\nForeign_keys = [countries.Continent = continents.ContId,car_makers.Country = countries.CountryId,model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id,car_names.Model = model_list.Model,cars_data.Id = car_names.MakeId]"

For this prompt, we can ask a specific question:

"Q: how many car makers are their in germany?"

And we have an expected answer:

"A: SELECT count ( * )  FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN COUNTRIES AS T2 ON T1.Country   =   T2.CountryId WHERE T2.CountryName   =   'germany'"

The dataset needs to be in the following format:

"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "<input prompt>"}, {"role": "user", "content": <user input>}, "ideal": "correct answer"]

Putting it all together, we get:

{"input": [{"role": "system", "content": "TASK: Answer the following question with syntactically correct SQLite SQL. The SQL should be correct and be in context of the previous question-answer pairs.\nTable car_makers, columns = [*,Id,Maker,FullName,Country]\nTable car_names, columns = [*,MakeId,Model,Make]\nTable cars_data, columns = [*,Id,MPG,Cylinders,Edispl,Horsepower,Weight,Accelerate,Year]\nTable continents, columns = [*,ContId,Continent]\nTable countries, columns = [*,CountryId,CountryName,Continent]\nTable model_list, columns = [*,ModelId,Maker,Model]\nForeign_keys = [countries.Continent = continents.ContId,car_makers.Country = countries.CountryId,model_list.Maker = car_makers.Id,car_names.Model = model_list.Model,cars_data.Id = car_names.MakeId]\n"}, {"role": "system", "content": "Q: how many car makers are their in germany"}, "ideal": ["A: SELECT count ( * )  FROM CAR_MAKERS AS T1 JOIN COUNTRIES AS T2 ON T1.Country   =   T2.CountryId WHERE T2.CountryName   =   'germany'"]}

One way to speed up the process of building eval datasets, is to use GPT-4 to generate synthetic data

## Use GPT-4 to generate synthetic data
# Define the system prompt and user input (these should be filled as per the specific use case)
system_prompt = """You are a helpful assistant that can ask questions about a database table and write SQL queries to answer the question.
    A user will pass in a table schema and your job is to return a question answer pairing. The question should relevant to the schema of the table,
    and you can speculate on its contents. You will then have to generate a SQL query to answer the question. Below are some examples of what this should look like.

    Example 1
    ```````````
    User input: Table museum, columns = [*,Museum_ID,Name,Num_of_Staff,Open_Year]\nTable visit, columns = [*,Museum_ID,visitor_ID,Num_of_Ticket,Total_spent]\nTable visitor, columns = [*,ID,Name,Level_of_membership,Age]\nForeign_keys = [visit.visitor_ID = visitor.ID,visit.Museum_ID = museum.Museum_ID]\n
    Assistant Response:
    Q: How many visitors have visited the museum with the most staff?
    A: SELECT count ( * )  FROM VISIT AS T1 JOIN MUSEUM AS T2 ON T1.Museum_ID   =   T2.Museum_ID WHERE T2.Num_of_Staff   =   ( SELECT max ( Num_of_Staff )  FROM MUSEUM ) 
    ```````````

    User input: Table museum, columns = [*,Museum_ID,Name,Num_of_Staff,Open_Year]\nTable visit, columns = [*,Museum_ID,visitor_ID,Num_of_Ticket,Total_spent]\nTable visitor, columns = [*,ID,Name,Level_of_membership,Age]\nForeign_keys = [visit.visitor_ID = visitor.ID,visit.Museum_ID = museum.Museum_ID]\n
    Assistant Response:
    Q: What are the names who have a membership level higher than 4?
    A: SELECT Name   FROM VISITOR AS T1 WHERE T1.Level_of_membership   >   4 
    ```````````

Next we need to create the eval registry to run it in the framework.

The evals framework requires a .yaml file structured with the following properties:

id - An identifier for your eval
description - A short description of your eval
disclaimer - An additional notes about your eval
metrics - There are three types of eval metrics we can choose from: match, includes, fuzzyMatch
For our eval, we will configure the following:

"""
spider-sql:
  id: spider-sql.dev.v0
  metrics: [accuracy]

Running an evaluation
We can run this eval using the oaieval CLI. To get setup, install the library: pip install . (if you are running the OpenAI Evals library locally) or pip install oaieval if you are running an existing eval.

Then, run the eval using the CLI: oaieval gpt-3.5-turbo spider-sql

This command expects a model name and an eval set name. Note that we provide two command line interfaces (CLIs): oaieval for running a single eval and oaievalset for running a set of evals. The valid eval names are specified in the YAML files under evals/registry/evals and their corresponding implementations can be found in evals/elsuite.

!pip install evals --quiet

The oaieval CLI can accept various flags to modify the default behavior. You can run oaieval --help to see a full list of CLI options.

After running that command, you’ll see the final report of accuracy printed to the console, as well as a file path to a temporary file that contains the full report.

These CLIs can accept various flags to modify their default behavior. You can run oaieval --help to see a full list of CLI options.

oaieval will search for the spider-sql eval YAML file in the evals/registry/evals directory, following the format specified in cell 4 above. The path to the eval dataset is specified in the eval YAML file under the args: parameter as samples_jsonl: sql/spider_sql.jsonl, with the file content in JSONL format (as generated in step 3 above).

After running that command, you’ll see the final report of accuracy printed to the console, as well as a file path to a temporary file that contains the full report.

Reviewing some of the failures we see the following:

The second incorrect answer had an unnecessary join with the 'Templates' table. Our eval was able to accurately identify this and flag this as incorrect.
Few other answers have minor syntax differences that caused the answers to get flagged.
In situations like this, it would be worthwhile exploring whether we should continue iterating on the prompt to ensure certain stylistic choices, or if we should modify the evaluation suite to capture this variation.
This type of failure hints at the potential need for model-graded evals as a way to ensure accuracy in grading the results
Conclusion
Building out effective evals is a core part of the development cycle of LLM-based applications. The OpenAI Evals framework provides the core structure of building evals out of the box, and allows you to quickly spin up new tests for your various use cases. In this guide, we demonstrated step-by-step how to create an eval, run it, and analyze the results.

The example shown in this guide represent a straightfoward use case for evals. As you continue to explore this framework, we recommend you explore creating more complex model-graded evals for actual production use cases. Happy evaluating!

The new GPT-4 Turbo model, available as gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09 as of April 2024, now enables function calling with vision capabilities, better reasoning and a knowledge cutoff date of Dec 2023. Using images with function calling will unlock multimodal use cases and the ability to use reasoning, allowing you to go beyond OCR and image descriptions.

We will go through two examples to demonstrate the use of function calling with GPT-4 Turbo with Vision:

1. Simulating a customer service assistant for delivery exception support
We will simulate a customer service assistant for a delivery service that is equipped to analyze images of packages. The assistant will perform the following actions based on the image analysis:

If a package appears damaged in the image, automatically process a refund according to policy.
If the package looks wet, initiate a replacement.
If the package appears normal and not damaged, escalate to an agent.
Let's look at the sample images of packages that the customer service assistant will analyze to determine the appropriate action. We will encode the images as base64 strings for processing by the model.

# Function to encode the image as base64
def encode_image(image_path: str):
    # check if the image exists
    if not os.path.exists(image_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Image file not found: {image_path}")
    with open(image_path, "rb") as image_file:
        return base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')


# Sample images for testing
image_dir = "images"

# encode all images within the directory
image_files = os.listdir(image_dir)
image_data = {}
for image_file in image_files:
    image_path = os.path.join(image_dir, image_file)
    # encode the image with key as the image file name
    image_data[image_file.split('.')[0]] = encode_image(image_path)
    print(f"Encoded image: {image_file}")


def display_images(image_data: dict):
    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(18, 6))
    for i, (key, value) in enumerate(image_data.items()):
        img = Image.open(BytesIO(base64.b64decode(value)))
        ax = axs[i]
        ax.imshow(img)
        ax.axis("off")
        ax.set_title(key)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()


display_images(image_data)

Encoded image: damaged_package.jpg
Encoded image: normal_package.jpg
image generated by notebook
We have successfully encoded the sample images as base64 strings and displayed them. The customer service assistant will analyze these images to determine the appropriate action based on the package condition.

Let's now define the functions/tools for order processing, such as escalating an order to an agent, refunding an order, and replacing an order. We will create placeholder functions to simulate the processing of these actions based on the identified tools. We will be using Pydantic models to define the structure of the data for order actions.

MODEL = "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09"

class Order(BaseModel):
    """Represents an order with details such as order ID, customer name, product name, price, status, and delivery date."""
    order_id: str = Field(..., description="The unique identifier of the order")
    product_name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the product")
    price: float = Field(..., description="The price of the product")
    status: str = Field(..., description="The status of the order")
    delivery_date: str = Field(..., description="The delivery date of the order")
# Placeholder functions for order processing

def get_order_details(order_id):
    # Placeholder function to retrieve order details based on the order ID
    return Order(
        order_id=order_id,
        product_name="Product X",
        price=100.0,
        status="Delivered",
        delivery_date="2024-04-10",
    )

def escalate_to_agent(order: Order, message: str):
    # Placeholder function to escalate the order to a human agent
    return f"Order {order.order_id} has been escalated to an agent with message: `{message}`"

def refund_order(order: Order):
    # Placeholder function to process a refund for the order
    return f"Order {order.order_id} has been refunded successfully."

def replace_order(order: Order):
    # Placeholder function to replace the order with a new one
    return f"Order {order.order_id} has been replaced with a new order."

class FunctionCallBase(BaseModel):
    rationale: Optional[str] = Field(..., description="The reason for the action.")
    image_description: Optional[str] = Field(
        ..., description="The detailed description of the package image."
    )
    action: Literal["escalate_to_agent", "replace_order", "refund_order"]
    message: Optional[str] = Field(
        ...,
        description="The message to be escalated to the agent if action is escalate_to_agent",
    )
    # Placeholder functions to process the action based on the order ID
    def __call__(self, order_id):
        order: Order = get_order_details(order_id=order_id)
        if self.action == "escalate_to_agent":
            return escalate_to_agent(order, self.message)
        if self.action == "replace_order":
            return replace_order(order)
        if self.action == "refund_order":
            return refund_order(order)

class EscalateToAgent(FunctionCallBase):
    """Escalate to an agent for further assistance."""
    pass

class OrderActionBase(FunctionCallBase):
    pass

class ReplaceOrder(OrderActionBase):
    """Tool call to replace an order."""
    pass

class RefundOrder(OrderActionBase):
    """Tool call to refund an order."""
    pass

Simulating user messages and processing the package images
We will simulate user messages containing the package images and process the images using the GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model. The model will identify the appropriate tool call based on the image analysis and the predefined actions for damaged, wet, or normal packages. We will then process the identified action based on the order ID and display the results.

# extract the tool call from the response
ORDER_ID = "12345"  # Placeholder order ID for testing
INSTRUCTION_PROMPT = "You are a customer service assistant for a delivery service, equipped to analyze images of packages. If a package appears damaged in the image, automatically process a refund according to policy. If the package looks wet, initiate a replacement. If the package appears normal and not damaged, escalate to agent. For any other issues or unclear images, escalate to agent. You must always use tools!"

def delivery_exception_support_handler(test_image: str):
    payload = {
        "model": MODEL,

        }
    ]
    function_calls = instructor.from_openai(

2. Analyzing an organizational chart to extract employee information
For the second example, we will analyze an organizational chart image to extract employee information, such as employee names, roles, managers, and manager roles. We will use GPT-4 Turbo with Vision to process the organizational chart image and extract structured data about the employees in the organization. Indeed, function calling lets us go beyond OCR to actually deduce and translate hierarchical relationships within the chart.

We will start with a sample organizational chart in PDF format that we want to analyze and convert the first page of the PDF to a JPEG image for analysis.

# Function to convert a single page PDF page to a JPEG image
def convert_pdf_page_to_jpg(pdf_path: str, output_path: str, page_number=0):
    if not os.path.exists(pdf_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"PDF file not found: {pdf_path}")
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    page = doc.load_page(page_number)  # 0 is the first page
    pix = page.get_pixmap()
    # Save the pixmap as a JPEG
    pix.save(output_path)


def display_img_local(image_path: str):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    display(img)


pdf_path = 'data/org-chart-sample.pdf'
output_path = 'org-chart-sample.jpg'

convert_pdf_page_to_jpg(pdf_path, output_path)
display_img_local(output_path)

image generated by notebook
The organizational chart image has been successfully extracted from the PDF file and displayed. Let's now define a function to analyze the organizational chart image using the new GPT4 Turbo with Vision. The function will extract information about the employees, their roles, and their managers from the image. We will use function/tool calling to specify the input parameters for the organizational structure, such as the employee name, role, and manager's name and role. We will use Pydantic models to define the structure of the data.

base64_img = encode_image(output_path)

class RoleEnum(str, Enum):
    """Defines possible roles within an organization."""
    CEO = "CEO"
    CTO = "CTO"
    CFO = "CFO"
    COO = "COO"
    EMPLOYEE = "Employee"
    MANAGER = "Manager"
    INTERN = "Intern"
    OTHER = "Other"

class Employee(BaseModel):
    """Represents an employee, including their name, role, and optional manager information."""
    employee_name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the employee")
    role: RoleEnum = Field(..., description="The role of the employee")
    manager_name: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="The manager's name, if applicable")
    manager_role: Optional[RoleEnum] = Field(None, description="The manager's role, if applicable")


class EmployeeList(BaseModel):
    """A list of employees within the organizational structure."""
    employees: List[Employee] = Field(..., description="A list of employees")

def parse_orgchart(base64_img: str) -> EmployeeList:
    response = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI()).chat.completions.create(
        model='gpt-4-turbo',
        response_model=EmployeeList,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": 'Analyze the given organizational chart and very carefully extract the information.',
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "image_url",
                        "image_url": {
                            "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_img}"
                        }
                    },
                ],
            }
        ],
    )
    return response

Now, we will define a function to parse the response from GPT-4 Turbo with Vision and extract the employee data. We will tabulate the extracted data for easy visualization. Please note that the accuracy of the extracted data may vary based on the complexity and clarity of the input image.

# call the functions to analyze the organizational chart and parse the response
result = parse_orgchart(base64_img)

# tabulate the extracted data
df = pd.DataFrame([{
    'employee_name': employee.employee_name,
    'role': employee.role.value,
    'manager_name': employee.manager_name,
    'manager_role': employee.manager_role.value if employee.manager_role else None
} for employee in result.employees])

display(df)

employee_name	role	manager_name	manager_role
0	Juliana Silva	CEO	None	None
1	Kim Chun Hei	CFO	Juliana Silva	CEO
2	Chad Gibbons	CTO	Juliana Silva	CEO
3	Chiaki Sato	COO	Juliana Silva	CEO
4	Cahaya Dewi	Manager	Kim Chun Hei	CFO
5	Shawn Garcia	Manager	Chad Gibbons	CTO
6	Aaron Loeb	Manager	Chiaki Sato	COO
7	Drew Feig	Employee	Cahaya Dewi	Manager
8	Richard Sanchez	Employee	Cahaya Dewi	Manager
9	Sacha Dubois	Intern	Cahaya Dewi	Manager
10	Olivia Wilson	Employee	Shawn Garcia	Manager
11	Matt Zhang	Intern	Shawn Garcia	Manager
12	Avery Davis	Employee	Aaron Loeb	Manager
13	Harper Russo	Employee	Aaron Loeb	Manager
14	Taylor Alonso	Intern	Aaron Loeb	Manager
The extracted data from the organizational chart has been successfully parsed and displayed in a DataFrame. This approach allows us to leverage GPT-4 Turbo with Vision capabilities to extract structured information from images, such as organizational charts and diagrams, and process the data for further analysis. By using function calling, we can extend the functionality of multimodal models to perform specific tasks or call external functions.

Let's now define the functions/tools for order processing, such as escalating an order to an agent, refunding an order, and replacing an order. We will create placeholder functions to simulate the processing of these actions based on the identified tools. We will be using Pydantic models to define the structure of the data for order actions.

Simulating user messages and processing the package images
We will simulate user messages containing the package images and process the images using the GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model. The model will identify the appropriate tool call based on the image analysis and the predefined actions for damaged, wet, or normal packages. We will then process the identified action based on the order ID and display the results.

# extract the tool call from the response
ORDER_ID = "12345"  # Placeholder order ID for testing
INSTRUCTION_PROMPT = "You are a customer service assistant for a delivery service, equipped to analyze images of packages. If a package appears damaged in the image, automatically process a refund according to policy. If the package looks wet, initiate a replacement. If the package appears normal and not damaged, escalate to agent. For any other issues or unclear images, escalate to agent. You must always use tools!"

2. Analyzing an organizational chart to extract employee information
For the second example, we will analyze an organizational chart image to extract employee information, such as employee names, roles, managers, and manager roles. We will use GPT-4 Turbo with Vision to process the organizational chart image and extract structured data about the employees in the organization. Indeed, function calling lets us go beyond OCR to actually deduce and translate hierarchical relationships within the chart.

We will start with a sample organizational chart in PDF format that we want to analyze and convert the first page of the PDF to a JPEG image for analysis.

# Function to convert a single page PDF page to a JPEG image
def convert_pdf_page_to_jpg(pdf_path: str, output_path: str, page_number=0):
    if not os.path.exists(pdf_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"PDF file not found: {pdf_path}")
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    page = doc.load_page(page_number)  # 0 is the first page
    pix = page.get_pixmap()
    # Save the pixmap as a JPEG
    pix.save(output_path)


def display_img_local(image_path: str):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    display(img)


pdf_path = 'data/org-chart-sample.pdf'
output_path = 'org-chart-sample.jpg'

convert_pdf_page_to_jpg(pdf_path, output_path)
display_img_local(output_path)

image generated by notebook
The organizational chart image has been successfully extracted from the PDF file and displayed. Let's now define a function to analyze the organizational chart image using the new GPT4 Turbo with Vision. The function will extract information about the employees, their roles, and their managers from the image. We will use function/tool calling to specify the input parameters for the organizational structure, such as the employee name, role, and manager's name and role. We will use Pydantic models to define the structure of the data.

base64_img = encode_image(output_path)

class RoleEnum(str, Enum):
    """Defines possible roles within an organization."""
    CEO = "CEO"
    CTO = "CTO"
    CFO = "CFO"
    COO = "COO"
    EMPLOYEE = "Employee"
    MANAGER = "Manager"
    INTERN = "Intern"
    OTHER = "Other"

class Employee(BaseModel):
    """Represents an employee, including their name, role, and optional manager information."""
    employee_name: str = Field(..., description="The name of the employee")
    role: RoleEnum = Field(..., description="The role of the employee")
    manager_name: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="The manager's name, if applicable")
    manager_role: Optional[RoleEnum] = Field(None, description="The manager's role, if applicable")


class EmployeeList(BaseModel):
    """A list of employees within the organizational structure."""
    employees: List[Employee] = Field(..., description="A list of employees")

def parse_orgchart(base64_img: str) -> EmployeeList:
    response = instructor.from_openai(OpenAI()).chat.completions.create(
        model='gpt-4-turbo',
        response_model=EmployeeList,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": 'Analyze the given organizational chart and very carefully extract the information.',
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {
                        "type": "image_url",
                        "image_url": {
                            "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_img}"
                        }
                    },
                ],
            }
        ],
    )
    return response

Now, we will define a function to parse the response from GPT-4 Turbo with Vision and extract the employee data. We will tabulate the extracted data for easy visualization. Please note that the accuracy of the extracted data may vary based on the complexity and clarity of the input image.

# call the functions to analyze the organizational chart and parse the response
result = parse_orgchart(base64_img)

# tabulate the extracted data
df = pd.DataFrame([{
    'employee_name': employee.employee_name,
    'role': employee.role.value,
    'manager_name': employee.manager_name,
    'manager_role': employee.manager_role.value if employee.manager_role else None
} for employee in result.employees])

display(df)

employee_name	role	manager_name	manager_role
0	Juliana Silva	CEO	None	None
1	Kim Chun Hei	CFO	Juliana Silva	CEO
2	Chad Gibbons	CTO	Juliana Silva	CEO
3	Chiaki Sato	COO	Juliana Silva	CEO
4	Cahaya Dewi	Manager	Kim Chun Hei	CFO
5	Shawn Garcia	Manager	Chad Gibbons	CTO
6	Aaron Loeb	Manager	Chiaki Sato	COO
7	Drew Feig	Employee	Cahaya Dewi	Manager
8	Richard Sanchez	Employee	Cahaya Dewi	Manager
9	Sacha Dubois	Intern	Cahaya Dewi	Manager
10	Olivia Wilson	Employee	Shawn Garcia	Manager
11	Matt Zhang	Intern	Shawn Garcia	Manager
12	Avery Davis	Employee	Aaron Loeb	Manager
13	Harper Russo	Employee	Aaron Loeb	Manager
14	Taylor Alonso	Intern	Aaron Loeb	Manager
The extracted data from the organizational chart has been successfully parsed and displayed in a DataFrame. This approach allows us to leverage GPT-4 Turbo with Vision capabilities to extract structured information from images, such as organizational charts and diagrams, and process the data for further analysis. By using function calling, we can extend the functionality of multimodal models to perform specific tasks or call external functions.
["CUSTOMER-SERVICE!"]
Using tool required for customer service

OpenAI Logo
Colin Jarvis
Apr 30, 2024
Open in Github
The ChatCompletion endpoint now includes the ability to specify whether a tool must be called every time, by adding tool_choice='required' as a parameter.

This adds an element of determinism to how you build your wrapping application, as you can count on a tool being provided with every call. We'll demonstrate here how this can be useful for a contained flow like customer service, where having the ability to define specific exit points gives more control.

The notebook concludes with a multi-turn evaluation, where we spin up a customer GPT to imitate our customer and test the LLM customer service agent we've set up.

import json
from openai import OpenAI
import os

client = OpenAI()
GPT_MODEL = 'gpt-4-turbo'

Config definition
We will define tools and instructions which our LLM customer service agent will use. It will source the right instructions for the problem the customer is facing, and use those to answer the customer's query.

As this is a demo example, we'll ask the model to make up values where it doesn't have external systems to source info.

Example
To test this we will run an example for a customer who has experienced fraud, and see how the model handles it.

Play the role of the user and provide plausible next steps to keep the conversation going.

messages = submit_user_message("Hi, I have had an item stolen that was supposed to be delivered to me yesterday.")

User: Hi, I have had an item stolen that was supposed to be delivered to me yesterday.
Calling function get_instructions
Calling function speak_to_user
Assistant: I'm sorry to hear about the stolen item. Could you please provide me with more details about the fraudulent activity, including the date and the items involved? This information will help us to investigate the issue further and proceed with the necessary actions, including offering you a refund.
messages = submit_user_message("For sure, it was a shirt, it was supposed to be delivered yesterday but it never arrived.",messages)

User: For sure, it was a shirt, it was supposed to be delivered yesterday but it never arrived.
Calling function speak_to_user
Assistant: Thank you for providing the details. I will now proceed to report this incident to our security team for further investigation and arrange a refund for the stolen shirt. Please confirm if you would like me to go ahead with the refund.
Calling function speak_to_user
Assistant: Thank you for contacting us about this issue. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any more questions or need further assistance in the future.
messages = submit_user_message("Yes I would like to proceed with the refund.",messages)

User: Yes I would like to proceed with the refund.
Calling function get_instructions
Calling function speak_to_user
Assistant: Thank you for confirming. I have processed the refund for the stolen shirt. The amount should be reflected in your account within 5-7 business days. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please feel free to contact us.

GPT Actions library (Middleware) - Azure Functions

OpenAI Logo

May 23, 2024
Open in Github
Introduction
This page provides an instruction & guide for developers building middleware to connect a GPT Action to a specific application. Before you proceed, make sure to first familiarize yourself with the following information:

Introduction to GPT Actions
Introduction to GPT Actions Library
Example of Building a GPT Action from Scratch
This particular GPT Action provides an overview of how to build an Azure Function, MSFT's cloud-based function builder. This documentation helps a user set up an OAuth-protected Azure Function to connect to a GPT Action, and to a sample application.

Value + Example Business Use Cases
Value: Users can now leverage ChatGPT's natural language capability to connect directly to Azure Function. This can in a few ways:

100k character limit in GPT Actions: users can use the middleware to pre-process the text response from an API. For example, you can use OpenAI’s API in the middleware to summarize the text before sending it back to ChatGPT.
Typically for actions, users are relying on the SaaS API to return text. You can convert the response for the vendor API into easily digestible text, and it can handle different data types such as structured and unstructured data.
It can return files instead of just text. This can be useful to surface CSV files for Data Analysis, or bring back an PDF file and ChatGPT will treat it like an upload.
Example Use Cases:

A user needs to look up files in Sharepoint, but needs a middleware app between ChatGPT and Sharepoint
A user has built several steps in a row in an Azure function, and needs to be able to kick off that process using ChatGPT
Application Information
Application Key Links
Check out these links from the application before you get started:

Application Website: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/
Application API Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference/
Application Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you go through the following steps in your application environment:

Azure Portal with access to create Azure Function Apps and Azure Entra App Registrations
Application Setup
Installing the app
You can read more about languages and deployment options for Azure Functions on the left hand side of the documentation here. 

Option 1: Use VSCode
See Microsoft’s documentation here for how to deploy using VSCode. If you have familiarity with this approach, feel free to use it. 

Option 2: Directly in Azure Portal
See the documentation here for how to deploy using the Azure portal. We’ll walk through an example here step by step.

Part 1: Create Function


Create an Azure Function app. I used the following settings but you can use anything you are comfortable with. Note that not every language / operating system allows for editing the functions in the console directly - the combination I chose below does. For my walkthrough, I left everything as default and made the selections below. The below settings work out of the box for the SharePoint Node.js solutions here and here.

Basics

Do you want to deploy code or container image?:  Code

Runtime stack: Node.js

Operating system: Windows

Networking

Enable public access: on (need this on to connect to the GPT)
After completing the above, you’ll land on the “Deployments” page. Once the deployment completes (which should only take a few minutes) click on “Go to Resource” to go back to the Function App

You may get an error the first time you attempt this, click create again and it will likely work.

Part 2: Set up Auth
On the left-hand side menu of the Azure Function App, click on Authentication under the Settings menu. 

Add identity provider

Select Microsoft as identity provider. 

Workforce as tenant type

Create a new application. The instructions are fairly similar if you are using an existing application, but it is easier to create a new application as it will have the callback URLs and the API exposed automatically using “Easy Auth”. You can read more about that here.

Leave all the other settings on this page as the default, but feel free to change based on your internal guidelines.

On the permissions tab, click Add Permission and add Files.Read.All and Sites.ReadAll, then Add. This allows this application to read files which is important in order to use the Microsoft Graph Search API. If you are not using this for the SharePoint solution here and here you can skip this.

Once it is created, click on the enterprise application you just created (so, leave the Function App page and land on the Enterprise Application that you just spun up). We are now going to give it one more permission, to execute the Azure Function by impersonating the user logging into the application. See here for more details.

On the main page, click “View API Permissions”

Search for Microsoft Azure App Service in the APIs my organization uses and find user_impersonation 

Add it, then you’ll need an Admin on Azure Portal to Grant Admin Consent.

Within that enterprise application, Click on “Expose an API” on the left hand menu under Manage, then copy the scope that was created using the Copy to Clipboard button. The scope should look like “api://<insert-uuid>/user_impersonation”. Save this for later as SCOPE.

Click on “Authentication” on the left hand menu under Manage

Under the Web section, you’ll notice one callback URI was added automatically. Add the Postman redirect URI (https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback) for testing.
On the left-hand side, go to Overview. Copy the application (client) ID and and the directory (tenant) ID and save for later as CLIENT_ID and TENANT_ID.

Part 3: Set up Test Function
Leave the page by going home and then back to your Function App.

Click on Create Function. For this example, I’m going to develop it in the portal, but you can also use VSCode or another IDE.

Choose HTTP trigger

For Authorization Level, you can choose any key type you want.

Note this may error out the first time, but it is likely the Function did create, do a refresh of the page to check.
Click on the function you just created (You may need to click refresh to see it). Click on Get Function URL and save it to test in Postman. You will also use this when creating the OpenAPI spec later when you put it into the GPT. 



Go back to the function app and click on Configuration. Show the value for the MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET variable, copy it (click advanced edit to copy it), and save it for later.  
At this point, you should have a test function created, and you should have saved a client id, tenant id, secret, scope, and function URL. You are now ready to test out the authentication in Postman

Part 4: Test Authentication in Postman
Try to hit endpoint you created in Postman using those OAuth settings:

Grant Type: Authorization Code

Auth URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/`TENANT_ID`/oauth2/v2.0/authorize

Auth Token URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/`TENANT_ID`/oauth2/v2.0/token

Client ID: CLIENT_ID from step 7 above

Client secret: MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET from step 11 above

Scope: SCOPE from step 5 above

Client credentials: Send client credentials in body

You will need to click Get New Access Token, and then hit the endpoint you saved in step 10 above. If it was successful, you should get this response: ”This HTTP triggered function executed successfully. Pass a name in the query string or in the request body for a personalized response.”

Part 5: Set up your Application on an Azure Function
This should be done separately and is specific to your app. See the Sharepoint Cookbook for an example of that.

Part 6: Set up ChatGPT
Generate an OpenAPI spec for your endpoint. 

Paste that into the Actions section of a GPT, and choose OAuth as the authentication type. Fill out the OAuth settings the same way you did for Postman above. 

Once you save the action, you will see a callback URI at the bottom of the GPT configuration. Copy that URL, then go back to your Function App in the Azure Portal.

Click on Authentication under Settings, then click on your Entra application.

Once you are there, then click Authentication under the Manage section.

Add a new Redirect URI under the Web section of that page, and paste in the Callback URI you got from step 16, then click Save. 

Test out the GPT and it should work as expected.

Introduction
This page provides an instruction & guide for developers building a GPT Action for a specific application. Before you proceed, make sure to first familiarize yourself with the following information:

Introduction to GPT Actions
Introduction to GPT Actions Library
Example of Building a GPT Action from Scratch
This solution enables a GPT action to answer a user’s question with the context of files the user can access in SharePoint or Office365, using Microsoft’s Graph API search capabilities and the ability to retrieve files. It uses Azure Functions to process the Graph API response and convert it to a human readable format or structure it in a way ChatGPT understands. This code is meant to be directional, and you should modify it to your requirements.

This solution pre-processes the file within the Azure Function. The Azure Function returns text, instead of the base64 encoded file. Due to the pre-processing and the conversion to text, this solution is best used for large, unstructured documents, and for when you want to analyze more than the amount of files supported in the first solution (see documentation here).

Value + Example Business Use Cases
Value: Users can now leverage ChatGPT's natural language capability to connect directly to files in Sharpeoint

Example Use Cases:

A user needs to look up which files relate to a certain topic
A user needs an answer to a critical question, buried deep in documents
Architecture / Example


This solution uses a Node.js Azure Function to, based on the logged in user:

Search for a relevant file that the user has access to, based on the user’s initial question.

For each file that is found, convert it to a consistent readable format and retrieve all the text.

Use GPT 4o mini (gpt-4o-mini) to extract the relevant text from the files based on the initial user’s question. Note the pricing of GPT 4o mini here - since we are dealing with small token chunks, the cost of this step is nominal.  

Returns that data to ChatGPT. The GPT then uses that information to respond to the user's initial question.

As you can see from the below architecture diagram, the first three steps are the same as Solution 1. The main difference is that this solution converts the file to text instead of a base64 string, and then summarizes that text using GPT 4o mini.



Application Information
Application Key Links
Check out these links from the application before you get started:

Application Website: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/sharepoint/collaboration
Application API Documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-rest-reference/
Application Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you go through the following steps in your application environment:

Access to a Sharepoint environment
Postman (and knowledge of APIs and OAuth)
An OpenAI API Key from platform.openai.com
Middleware Information
If you follow the search concept files guide, the Microsoft Graph Search API returns references to files that fit the criteria, but not the file contents themselves. Therefore, middleware is required, rather than hitting the MSFT endpoints directly.

Steps:

loop through the returned files and download the files using the Download File endpoint or Convert File endpoint

convert that Binary stream to human readable text using pdf-parse

Then, we can optimize further by summarizing using gpt-4o-mini in the function to help with the 100,000 character limit we impose on Actions today. 

Additional Steps
Set up Azure Function
Set up an Azure Function using the steps in the Azure Function cookbook
Add in Function Code
Now that you have an authenticated Azure Function, we can update the function to search SharePoint / O365

Go to your test function and paste in the code from this file. Save the function.
This code is meant to be directional - while it should work out of the box, it is designed to be customized to your needs (see examples towards the end of this document).

Set up the following env variables by going to the Configuration tab on the left under Settings. Note that this may be listed directly in Environment Variables depending on your Azure UI.

TENANT_ID: copied from previous section

CLIENT_ID: copied from previous section

OPENAI_API_KEY: spin up an OpenAI API key on platform.openai.com.

Go to the Console tab under the Development Tools

Install the following packages in console

npm install @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client

npm install axios

npm install pdf-parse

npm install openai

Once this is complete, try calling the function (POST call) from Postman again, putting the below into body (using a query and search term you think will generate responses).

{
    "query": "<choose a question>",
    "searchTerm": "<choose a search term>"
}

If you get a response, you are ready to set this up with a Custom GPT!

Detailed Walkthrough
The below walks through setup instructions and walkthrough unique to this solution of pre-processing the files and extracting summaries in the Azure Function. You can find the entire code here.

Code Walkthrough
Implementing the Authentication 
Below we have a few helper functions that we’ll use in the function.

Initializing the Microsoft Graph Client
Create a function to initialize the Graph client with an access token. This will be used to search through Office 365 and SharePoint.

const { Client } = require('@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client');
 
function initGraphClient(accessToken) {
    return Client.init({
        authProvider: (done) => {
            done(null, accessToken);
        }
    });
}

Obtaining an On-Behalf-Of (OBO) Token
This function uses an existing bearer token to request an OBO token from Microsoft's identity platform. This enables passing through the credentials to ensure the search only returns files the logged-in user can access.

const axios = require('axios');
const qs = require('querystring');
 
async function getOboToken(userAccessToken) {
    const { TENANT_ID, CLIENT_ID, MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET } = process.env;
    const params = {
        client_id: CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret: MICROSOFT_PROVIDER_AUTHENTICATION_SECRET,
        grant_type: 'urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer',
        assertion: userAccessToken,
        requested_token_use: 'on_behalf_of',
        scope: 'https://graph.microsoft.com/.default'
    };
 
    const url = `https\://login.microsoftonline.com/${TENANT_ID}/oauth2/v2.0/token`;
    try {
        const response = await axios.post(url, qs.stringify(params), {
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' }
        });
        return response.data.access\_token;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error obtaining OBO token:', error.response?.data || error.message);
        throw error;
    }
}

Retrieving Content from O365 / SharePoint Items
This function fetches the content of drive items, handling different file types and converting files to PDF when necessary for text extraction. This uses the download endpoint for PDFs and the convert endpoint for other supported file types.

const getDriveItemContent = async (client, driveId, itemId, name) => {
    try {
        const fileType = path.extname(name).toLowerCase();
        // the below files types are the ones that are able to be converted to PDF to extract the text. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/driveitem-get-content-format?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http
        const allowedFileTypes = ['.pdf', '.doc', '.docx', '.odp', '.ods', '.odt', '.pot', '.potm', '.potx', '.pps', '.ppsx', '.ppsxm', '.ppt', '.pptm', '.pptx', '.rtf'];
        // filePath changes based on file type, adding ?format=pdf to convert non-pdf types to pdf for text extraction, so all files in allowedFileTypes above are converted to pdf
        const filePath = `/drives/${driveId}/items/${itemId}/content` + ((fileType === '.pdf' || fileType === '.txt' || fileType === '.csv') ? '' : '?format=pdf');
        if (allowedFileTypes.includes(fileType)) {
            response = await client.api(filePath).getStream();
            // The below takes the chunks in response and combines
            let chunks = [];
            for await (let chunk of response) {
                chunks.push(chunk);
            }
            let buffer = Buffer.concat(chunks);
            // the below extracts the text from the PDF.
            const pdfContents = await pdfParse(buffer);
            return pdfContents.text;
        } else if (fileType === '.txt') {
            // If the type is txt, it does not need to create a stream and instead just grabs the content
            response = await client.api(filePath).get();
            return response;
        }  else if (fileType === '.csv') {
            response = await client.api(filePath).getStream();
            let chunks = [];
            for await (let chunk of response) {
                chunks.push(chunk);
            }
            let buffer = Buffer.concat(chunks);
            let dataString = buffer.toString('utf-8');
            return dataString
            
    } else {
        return 'Unsupported File Type';
    }
     
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching drive content:', error);
        throw new Error(`Failed to fetch content for ${name}: ${error.message}`);
    }
};

Integrating GPT 4o mini for Text Analysis
This function utilizes the OpenAI SDK to analyze text extracted from documents and find relevant information based on a user query. This helps to ensure only relevant text to the user’s question is returned to the GPT. 

const getRelevantParts = async (text, query) => {
    try {
        // We use your OpenAI key to initialize the OpenAI client
        const openAIKey = process.env["OPENAI_API_KEY"];
        const openai = new OpenAI({
            apiKey: openAIKey,
        });
        const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
            // Using gpt-4o-mini due to speed to prevent timeouts. You can tweak this prompt as needed
            model: "gpt-4o-mini",
            messages: [
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that finds relevant content in text based on a query. You only return the relevant sentences, and you return a maximum of 10 sentences"},
                {"role": "user", "content": `Based on this question: **"${query}"**, get the relevant parts from the following text:*****\n\n${text}*****. If you cannot answer the question based on the text, respond with 'No information provided'`}
            ],
            // using temperature of 0 since we want to just extract the relevant content
            temperature: 0,
            // using max_tokens of 1000, but you can customize this based on the number of documents you are searching. 
            max_tokens: 1000
        });
        return response.choices[0].message.content;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error with OpenAI:', error);
        return 'Error processing text with OpenAI' + error;
    }
};

Creating the Azure Function to Handle Requests
Now that we have all these helper functions, the Azure Function will orchestrate the flow, by authenticating the user, performing the search, and iterating through the search results to extract the text and retrieve the relevant parts of the text to the GPT.

Handling HTTP Requests: The function starts by extracting the query and searchTerm from the HTTP request. It checks if the Authorization header is present and extracts the bearer token.

Authentication: Using the bearer token, it obtains an OBO token from Microsoft's identity platform using getOboToken defined above.

Initializing the Graph Client: With the OBO token, it initializes the Microsoft Graph client using initGraphClient defined above.

Document Search: It constructs a search query and sends it to the Microsoft Graph API to find documents based on the searchTerm.

Document Processing: For each document returned by the search:

It retrieves the document content using getDriveItemContent.

If the file type is supported, it analyzes the content using getRelevantParts, which sends the text to OpenAI's model for extracting relevant information based on the query.

Customizations
Below are some potential areas to customize. 

You can customize the GPT prompt to search again a certain amount of times if nothing is found.

You can customize the code to only search through specific SharePoint sites or O365 Drives by customizing the search query. This will help focus the search and improve the retrieval. The function as setup now looks through all files the logged-in user can access.

You could use gpt-4o instead of gpt-4o-mini. This would slightly increase the cost and latency, but you may get higher quality summarizations.

You can customize the amount of files it searches through within the call to Microsoft Graph.

Considerations
Note that all the same limitations of Actions apply here, with regards to returning 100K characters or less and the 45 second timeout.

This only works for text, not for images. With some additional code in the Azure Function, you could customize this by using GPT-4o to extract summarizations of images.

This does not work for structured data. We recommend Solution 1 if structured data is a major part of your use case.

ChatGPT Steps
Custom GPT Instructions
Once you've created a Custom GPT, copy the text below in the Instructions panel. Have questions? Check out Getting Started Example to see how this step works in more detail.

You are a Q&A helper that helps answer users questions. You have access to a documents repository through your API action. When a user asks a question, you pass in that question exactly as stated to the "query" parameter, and for the "searchTerm" you use a single keyword or term you think you should use for the search.

****

Scenario 1: There are answers

If your action returns results, then you take the results from the action and summarize concisely with the webUrl returned from the action. You answer the users question to the best of your knowledge from the action

****

Scenario 2: No results found

If the response you get from the action is "No results found", stop there and let the user know there were no results and that you are going to try a different search term, and explain why. You must always let the user know before conducting another search.

Example:

****

I found no results for "DEI". I am now going to try [insert term] because [insert explanation]

****

Then, try a different searchTerm that is similar to the one you tried before, with a single word. 

Try this three times. After the third time, then let the user know you did not find any relevant documents to answer the question, and to check SharePoint. Be sure to be explicit about what you are searching for at each step.

****

In either scenario, try to answer the user's question. If you cannot answer the user's question based on the knowledge you find, let the user know and ask them to go check the HR Docs in SharePoint. If the file is a CSV, XLSX, or XLS, you can tell the user to download the file using the link and re-upload to use Advanced Data Analysis.

Authentication Instructions
Below are instructions on setting up authentication with this 3rd party application. Have questions? Check out Getting Started Example to see how this step works in more detail.

See above and on the Azure Function cookbook for more detailed instructions on authentication.

FAQ & Troubleshooting
Why are you using the Microsoft Graph API in your code instead of the SharePoint API?

The SharePoint API is legacy - per the Microsoft documentation here, “For SharePoint Online, innovation using a REST API against SharePoint is driven via the Microsoft Graph REST API's.” The Graph API gives us more flexibility, and the SharePoint API still runs into the same file issues listed in the Why is this necessary instead of interacting with the Microsoft Graph API directly? section.
What types of files does this support?

This supports all files listed in the documentation for the Convert File endpoint here. Specifically, it supports pdf, doc, docx, odp, ods, odt, pot, potm, potx, pps, ppsx, ppsxm, ppt, pptm, pptx, rtf.

When a search result returns XLS, XLSX, or CSV, this prompts the user to download the file and re-upload to ask questions using Advanced Data Analysis. As stated above, we recommend solution 1 if structured data is part of your use case.

Why do I need to request an OBO token?

When you try to use the same token to authenticate to the Graph API as the one you use to authenticate into the Azure Function, you get an “invalid audience” token. This is because the audience for the token can only be user_impersonation.

To address this, the function requests a new token scoped to Files.Read.All within the app using the On Behalf Of flow. This will inherit the permissions of the logged in user, meaning this function will only search through files the logged-in user has access to. 

We are purposefully requesting a new On Behalf Of token with each request, because Azure Function Apps are meant to be stateless. You could potentially integrate this with Azure Key Vault to store the secret and retrieve programmatically.

1. Building out an eval set
Imagine we are a customer support team that is building out an automated support agent. We will be feeding the assistant information from our knowledge base about a specific set of policies for how to handle tickets such as returns, refunds, feedback, and expect the model to follow the policy when interacting with customers.

The first thing we will do is use GPT-4o to build out a set of policies that we will want to follow.

If you want to do deep dive into generating synthetic data, you can review our Synthetic Data Generation Cookbook here

2. Constructing our hallucination guardrail
When building out our hallucination guardrail, here are some guiding principles:

Provide very descriptive metrics to evaluate whether a response is accurate
It is important to break down this idea of "truth" in easily identifiable metrics that we can measure
Metrics like truthfulness and relevance are difficult to measure. Giving concrete ways to score the statement can result in a more accurate guardrail
Ensure consistency across key terminology
It is important to keep relevant terms such as knowledge base articles, assistants, and users consistent across the prompt
If we begin to use phrases such as assistant vs agent, the model could get confused
Start with the most advanced model
There is a cost vs quality trade-off when using the most advanced models. Although GPT-4o may be more expensive, it is important to start with the most advanced model so we can ensure a high degree of accuracy
Once we have thoroughly tested out the guardrail and are confident in its performance, we can look to reducing cost by tuning it down to gpt-3.5-turbo
Evaluate each sentence independently and the entire response as a whole
If the agent returns a long response, it can be useful to break down the response to individual sentences and evaluate them independently
In addition to that, evaluating the whole intent of the message as a whole can ensure that you don't lose important context
With all of this in mind, let's build out a guardrail system and measure its performance.

guardrail_system_message = """You are a highly specialized assistant tasked with reviewing chatbot responses to identify and flag any inaccuracies or hallucinations. For each user message, you must thoroughly analyze the response by considering:
    1. Knowledge Accuracy: Does the message accurately reflect information found in the knowledge base? Assess not only direct mentions but also contextually inferred knowledge.
    2. Relevance: Does the message directly address the user's question or statement? Check if the response logically follows the user’s last message, maintaining coherence in the conversation thread.
    3. Policy Compliance: Does the message adhere to company policies? Evaluate for subtleties such as misinformation, overpromises, or logical inconsistencies. Ensure the response is polite, non-discriminatory, and practical.

To perform your task you will be given the following:
    1. Knowledge Base Articles - These are your source of truth for verifying the content of assistant messages.
    2. Chat Transcript - Provides context for the conversation between the user and the assistant.
    3. Assistant Message - The message from the assistant that needs review.

For each sentence in the assistant's most recent response, assign a score based on the following criteria:
    1. Factual Accuracy:
        - Score 1 if the sentence is factually correct and corroborated by the knowledge base.
        - Score 0 if the sentence contains factual errors or unsubstantiated claims.
    2. Relevance:
        - Score 1 if the sentence directly and specifically addresses the user's question or statement without digression.
        - Score 0 if the sentence is tangential or does not build logically on the conversation thread.
    3. Policy Compliance:
        - Score 1 if the response complies with all company policies including accuracy, ethical guidelines, and user engagement standards.
        - Score 0 if it violates any aspect of the policies, such as misinformation or inappropriate content.
    4. Contextual Coherence:
        - Score 1 if the sentence maintains or enhances the coherence of the conversation, connecting logically with preceding messages.
        - Score 0 if it disrupts the flow or context of the conversation.

Include in your response an array of JSON objects for each evaluated sentence. Each JSON object should contain:
    - `sentence`: Text of the evaluated sentence.
    - `factualAccuracy`: Score for factual correctness (0 or 1).
    - `factualReference`: If scored 1, cite the exact line(s) from the knowledge base. If scored 0, provide a rationale.
    - `relevance`: Score for relevance to the user’s question (0 or 1).
    - `policyCompliance`: Score for adherence to company policies (0 or 1).
    - `contextualCoherence`: Score for maintaining conversation coherence (0 or 1).

ALWAYS RETURN YOUR RESPONSE AS AN ARRAY OF JSONS.

Data Extraction and Transformation in ELT Workflows using GPT-4o as an OCR Alternative

OpenAI Logo
Charu Jaiswal
Jul 8, 2024
Open in Github
A lot of enterprise data is unstructured and locked up in difficult-to-use formats, e.g. PDFs, PPT, PNG, that are not optimized for use with LLMs or databases. As a result this type of data tends to be underutilized for analysis and product development, despite it being so valuable. The traditional way of extracting information from unstructured or non-ideal formats has been to use OCR, but OCR struggles with complex layouts and can have limited multilingual support. Moreover, manually applying transforms to data can be cumbersome and timeconsuming.

The multi-modal capabilities of GPT-4o enable new ways to extract and transform data because of GPT-4o's ability to adapt to different types of documents and to use reasoning for interpreting the content of documents. Here are some reasons why you would choose GPT-4o for your extraction and transformation workflows over traditional methods.

Extraction	Transformation
Adaptable: Handles complex document layouts better, reducing errors	Schema Adaptability: Easily transforms data to fit specific schemas for database ingestion
Multilingual Support: Seamlessly processes documents in multiple languages	Dynamic Data Mapping: Adapts to different data structures and formats, providing flexible transformation rules
Contextual Understanding: Extracts meaningful relationships and context, not just text	Enhanced Insight Generation: Applies reasoning to create more insightful transformations, enriching the dataset with derived metrics, metadata and relationships
Multimodality: Processes various document elements, including images and tables	
This cookbook has three parts:

How to extract data from multilingual PDFs
How to transform data according to a schema for loading into a database
How to load transformed data into a database for downstream analysis
We're going to mimic a simple ELT workflow where data is first extracted from PDFs into JSON using GPT-4o, stored in an unstructured format somewhere like a data lake, transformed to fit a schema using GPT-4o, and then finally ingested into a relational database for querying. It's worth noting that you can do all of this with the BatchAPI if you're interested in lowering the cost of this workflow.



The data we'll be using is a set of publicly available 2019 hotel invoices from Germany available on Jens Walter's GitHub, (thank you Jens!). Though hotel invoices generally contain similar information (reservation details, charges, taxes etc.), you'll notice that the invoices present itemized information in different ways and are multilingual containing both German and English. Fortunately GPT-4o can adapt to a variety of different document styles without us having to specify formats and it can seamlessly handle a variety of languages, even in the same document. Here is what one of the invoices looks like:



Part 1: Extracting data from PDFs using GPT-4o's vision capabilities
GPT-4o doesn't natively handle PDFs so before we extract any data we'll first need to convert each page into an image and then encode the images as base64.

from openai import OpenAI
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
import io
import os
from PIL import Image
import base64
import json

api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)


@staticmethod
def encode_image(image_path):

We can then pass each base64 encoded image in a GPT-4o LLM call, specifying a high level of detail and JSON as the response format. We're not concerned about enforcing a schema at this step, we just want all of the data to be extracted regardless of type.

Because invoice data can span multiple pages in a PDF, we're going to produce JSON objects for each page in the invoice and then append them together. The final invoice extraction will be a single JSON file.

Each invoice JSON will have different keys depending on what data the original invoice contained, so at this point you can store the unschematized JSON files in a data lake that can handle unstructured data. For simplicity though, we're going to store the files in a folder. Here is what one of the extracted JSON files looks like, you'll notice that even though we didn't specify a schema, GPT-4o was able to understand German and group similar information together. Moreover, if there was a blank field in the invoice GPT-4o transcribed that as "null".

Part 2: Transforming data according to a schema
You've extracted data from PDFs and have likely loaded the unstructured extractions as JSON objects in a data lake. The next step in our ELT workflow is to use GPT-4o to transform the extractions according to our desired schema. This will enable us to ingest any resulting tables into a database. We've decided upon the following schema that broadly covers most of the information we would have seen across the different invoices. This schema will be used to process each raw JSON extraction into our desired schematized JSON and can specify particular formats such as "date": "YYYY-MM-DD". We're also going to translate the data into English at this step.

To recap in this cookbook we showed you how to use GPT-4o for extracting and transforming data that would otherwise be inaccessible for data analysis. If you don't need these workflows to happen in real-time, you can take advantage of OpenAI's BatchAPI to run jobs asynchronously at a much lower cost!
How to automate AWS tasks with function calling

OpenAI Logo
cybercoder
Sep 26, 2023
Open in Github
This code demonstrates how to interact with ChatGPT functions to perform tasks related to Amazon S3 buckets. The notebook covers S3 bucket key functionalities such as running simple listing commands, searching for a specific file in all buckets, uploading a file to a bucket, and downloading a file from a bucket. The OpenAI Chat API understands the user instructions, generates the natural language responses, and extracts appropriate function calls based on the user's input.

Requirements: To run the notebook generate AWS access key with S3 bucket writing permission and store them in a local environment file alongside the Openai key. The ".env" file format:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-key>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>

! pip install openai
! pip install boto3
! pip install tenacity
! pip install python-dotenv

from openai import OpenAI
import json
import boto3
import os
import datetime
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

# load environment variables
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv() 

True
Initials
OpenAI.api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
GPT_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Optional - if you had issues loading the environment file, you can set the AWS values using the below code
# os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = ''
# os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = ''

# Create S3 client
s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

# Create openai client
client = OpenAI()

Utilities
To connect user questions or commands to the appropriate function, we need to provide ChatGPT with the necessary function details and expected parameters.

# Functions dict to pass S3 operations details for the GPT model

S3 bucket bot testing
In the following examples, make sure to replace the placeholders such as <file_name>, <bucket_name>, and <directory_path> with your specific values before execution.

Listing and searching
Let's start by listing all the available buckets.

print(run_conversation('list my S3 buckets'))

You can ask the assistant to search for a specific file name either in all the buckets or in a specific one.

search_file = '<file_name>'
print(run_conversation(f'search for a file {search_file} in all buckets'))

search_word = '<file_name_part>'
bucket_name = '<bucket_name>'
print(run_conversation(f'search for a file contains {search_word} in {bucket_name}'))

The model is expected to clarify the ask from the user in case of ambiguity in the parameters values as described in the system message.

print(run_conversation('search for a file'))

Sure, to help me find what you're looking for, could you please provide the name of the file you want to search for and the name of the S3 bucket? Also, should the search match the file name exactly, or should it also consider partial matches?
Validate edge cases
We also instructed the model to reject irrelevant tasks. Let's test it out and see how it works in action.

# the model should not answer details not related to the scope
print(run_conversation('what is the weather today'))

Apologies for the misunderstanding, but I am only able to assist with S3 bucket functions. Can you please ask a question related to S3 bucket functions?
The provided functions are not limited to just retrieving information. They can also assist the user in uploading or downloading files.

Download a file
search_file = '<file_name>'
bucket_name = '<bucket_name>'
local_directory = '<directory_path>'
print(run_conversation(f'download {search_file} from {bucket_name} bucket to {local_directory} directory'))

Upload a file
local_file = '<file_name>'
bucket_name = '<bucket_name>'
print(run_conversation(f'upload {local_file} to {bucket_name} bucket'))
Whisper prompting guide

OpenAI Logo
prestontuggle
Jun 26, 2023
Open in Github
OpenAI's audio transcription API has an optional parameter called prompt.

The prompt is intended to help stitch together multiple audio segments. By submitting the prior segment's transcript via the prompt, the Whisper model can use that context to better understand the speech and maintain a consistent writing style.

However, prompts do not need to be genuine transcripts from prior audio segments. Fictitious prompts can be submitted to steer the model to use particular spellings or styles.

This notebook shares two techniques for using fictitious prompts to steer the model outputs:

Transcript generation: GPT can convert instructions into fictitious transcripts for Whisper to emulate.
Spelling guide: A spelling guide can tell the model how to spell names of people, products, companies, etc.
These techniques are not especially reliable, but can be useful in some situations.

Comparison with GPT prompting
Prompting Whisper is not the same as prompting GPT. For example, if you submit an attempted instruction like "Format lists in Markdown format", the model will not comply, as it follows the style of the prompt, rather than any instructions contained within.

In addition, the prompt is limited to only 224 tokens. If the prompt is longer than 224 tokens, only the final 224 tokens of the prompt will be considered; all prior tokens will be silently ignored. The tokenizer used is the multilingual Whisper tokenizer.

To get good results, craft examples that portray your desired style.

Setup
To get started, let's:

Import the OpenAI Python library (if you don't have it, you'll need to install it with pip install openai)
Download a few example audio files
# imports
from openai import OpenAI  # for making OpenAI API calls
import urllib  # for downloading example audio files
import os

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<your OpenAI API key if not set as env var>"))

# set download paths
up_first_remote_filepath = "https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/upfirstpodcastchunkthree.wav"
bbq_plans_remote_filepath = "https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/bbq_plans.wav"
product_names_remote_filepath = "https://cdn.openai.com/API/examples/data/product_names.wav"

# set local save locations
up_first_filepath = "data/upfirstpodcastchunkthree.wav"
bbq_plans_filepath = "data/bbq_plans.wav"
product_names_filepath = "data/product_names.wav"

# download example audio files and save locally
urllib.request.urlretrieve(up_first_remote_filepath, up_first_filepath)
urllib.request.urlretrieve(bbq_plans_remote_filepath, bbq_plans_filepath)
urllib.request.urlretrieve(product_names_remote_filepath, product_names_filepath)

('data/product_names.wav', <http.client.HTTPMessage at 0x1105ac490>)
As a baseline, we'll transcribe an NPR podcast segment
Our audio file for this example will be a segment of the NPR podcast, Up First.

Let's get our baseline transcription, then introduce prompts.

# define a wrapper function for seeing how prompts affect transcriptions
def transcribe(audio_filepath, prompt: str) -> str:
    """Given a prompt, transcribe the audio file."""
    transcript = client.audio.transcriptions.create(
        file=open(audio_filepath, "rb"),
        model="whisper-1",
        prompt=prompt,
    )
    return transcript.text

# baseline transcription with no prompt
transcribe(up_first_filepath, prompt="")

"I stick contacts in my eyes. Do you really? Yeah. That works okay? You don't have to, like, just kind of pain in the butt every day to do that? No, it is. It is. And I sometimes just kind of miss the eye. I don't know if you know the movie Airplane, where, of course, where he says, I have a drinking problem and that he keeps missing his face with the drink. That's me and the contact lens. Surely, you must know that I know the movie Airplane. I do. I do know that. Stop calling me Shirley. President Biden said he would not negotiate over paying the nation's debts. But he is meeting today with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Other leaders of Congress will also attend. So how much progress can they make? I'm E. Martinez with Steve Inskeep, and this is Up First from NPR News. Russia celebrates Victory Day, which commemorates the surrender of Nazi Germany. Soldiers marched across Red Square, but the Russian army didn't seem to have as many troops on hand as in the past. So what does this ritual say about the war Russia is fighting right now?"
Transcripts follow the style of the prompt
In the unprompted transcript, 'President Biden' is capitalized. However, if we pass in a fictitious prompt of 'president biden' in lowercase, Whisper matches the style and generates a transcript in all lowercase.

# lowercase prompt
transcribe(up_first_filepath, prompt="president biden")

"I stick contacts in my eyes. Do you really? Yeah. That works okay? You don't have to, like, just kind of pain in the butt every day to do that? No, it is. It is. And I sometimes just kind of miss the eye. I don't know if you know the movie Airplane? Yes. Of course. Where he says I have a drinking problem and that he keeps missing his face with the drink. That's me and the contact lens. Surely, you must know that I know the movie Airplane. I do. I do know that. Don't call me Shirley. Stop calling me Shirley.

Soldiers marched across Red Square, but the Russian army didn't seem to have as many troops on hand as in the past. So what does this ritual say about the war Russia is fighting right now?"
Be aware that when prompts are short, Whisper may be less reliable at following their style.

# short prompts are less reliable

Now, let's switch to another audio recording authored specifically for this demonstration, on the topic of a odd barbecue.

To begin, we'll establish our baseline transcript using Whisper.

# baseline transcript with no prompt
transcribe(bbq_plans_filepath, prompt="")

"Hello, my name is Preston Tuggle. I'm based in New York City. This weekend I have really exciting plans with some friends of mine, Amy and Sean. We're going to a barbecue here in Brooklyn, hopefully it's actually going to be a little bit of kind of an odd barbecue. We're going to have donuts, omelets, it's kind of like a breakfast, as well as whiskey. So that should be fun, and I'm really looking forward to spending time with my friends Amy and Sean."
While Whisper's transcription was accurate, it had to guess at various spellings. For example, it assumed the friends' names were spelled Amy and Sean rather than Aimee and Shawn. Let's see if we can steer the spelling with a prompt.

# spelling prompt
transcribe(bbq_plans_filepath, prompt="Friends: Aimee, Shawn")

"Hello, my name is Preston Tuggle. I'm based in New York City. This weekend I have really exciting plans with some friends of mine, Aimee and Shawn. We're going to a barbecue here in Brooklyn.

Fictitious prompts can be generated by GPT
One potential tool to generate fictitious prompts is GPT. We can give GPT instructions and use it to generate long fictitious transcripts with which to prompt Whisper.

            },  # we pick an example topic (friends talking about a vacation) so that GPT does not refuse or ask clarifying questions

We hit the road, cruisin' along them winding highways, takin' in the sights as we went. I tell ya, the scenery up there was somethin' else. Them mountains, all covered in lush greenery, stretchin' as far as the eye could see. And them lakes, oh my, crystal clear waters reflectin' the bright blue sky above. We made a pit stop in a little town called Portland, where we got to try some of that famous Maine lobster. Now, I ain't never tasted anything quite like it.

And let me tell ya, that ocean breeze sure did feel mighty fine on our skin. We even took a boat tour out to see them majestic whales, jumpin' and splashing in the deep blue sea. It was a sight to behold, my friend. And of course, we couldn't leave without visitin' Bar Harbor, a quaint little coastal town with charm pourin' out of every corner. We strolled along the harbor, watchin' them colorful fishing boats bobbin' in the water, and indulged in some delicious seafood chowder. Maine sure did steal a piece of our hearts, my friend. The memories we made on that trip will stay with us forever.

How to implement LLM guardrails

OpenAI Logo
Colin Jarvis
Dec 18, 2023
Open in Github
In this notebook we share examples of how to implement guardrails for your LLM applications. A guardrail is a generic term for detective controls that aim to steer your application. Greater steerability is a common requirement given the inherent randomness of LLMs, and so creating effective guardrails has become one of the most common areas of performance optimization when pushing an LLM from prototype to production.

Guardrails are incredibly diverse and can be deployed to virtually any context you can imagine something going wrong with LLMs. This notebook aims to give simple examples that can be extended to meet your unique use case, as well as outlining the trade-offs to consider when deciding whether to implement a guardrail, and how to do it.

This notebook will focus on:

Input guardrails that flag inappropriate content before it gets to your LLM
Output guardrails that validate what your LLM has produced before it gets to the customer
Note: This notebook tackles guardrails as a generic term for detective controls around an LLM - for the official libraries that provide distributions of pre-built guardrails frameworks, please check out the following:

NeMo Guardrails
Guardrails AI
import openai

GPT_MODEL = 'gpt-4o-mini'

1. Input guardrails
Input guardrails aim to prevent inappropriate content getting to the LLM in the first place - some common use cases are:

Topical guardrails: Identify when a user asks an off-topic question and give them advice on what topics the LLM can help them with.
Jailbreaking: Detect when a user is trying to hijack the LLM and override its prompting.
Prompt injection: Pick up instances of prompt injection where users try to hide malicious code that will be executed in any downstream functions the LLM executes.
In all of these they act as a preventative control, running either before or in parallel with the LLM, and triggering your application to behave differently if one of these criteria are met.

Designing a guardrail
When designing guardrails it is important to consider the trade-off between accuracy, latency and cost, where you try to achieve maximum accuracy for the least impact to your bottom line and the user's experience.

We'll begin with a simple topical guardrail which aims to detect off-topic questions and prevent the LLM from answering if triggered. This guardrail consists of a simple prompt and uses gpt-4o-mini, maximising latency/cost holding a good enough accuracy, but if we wanted to optimize further we could consider:

Accuracy: You could consider fine-tuning gpt-4o-mini or few-shot examples to increase the accuracy. RAG can also be effective if you have a corpus of information that can help determine whether a piece of content is allowed or not.
Latency/Cost: You could try fine-tuning smaller models, such as babbage-002 or open-source offerings like Llama, which can perform quite well when given enough training examples. When using open-source offerings you can also tune the machines you are using for inference to maximize either cost or latency reduction.
This simple guardrail aims to ensure the LLM only answers to a predefined set of topics, and responds to out-of-bounds queries with a canned message.

Embrace async
A common design to minimize latency is to send your guardrails asynchronously along with your main LLM call. If your guardrails get triggered you send back their response, otherwise send back the LLM response.

We'll use this approach, creating an execute_chat_with_guardrails function that will run our LLM's get_chat_response and the topical_guardrail guardrail in parallel, and return the LLM response only if the guardrail returns allowed.

Limitations
You should always consider the limitations of guardrails when developing your design. A few of the key ones to be aware of are:

When using LLMs as a guardrail, be aware that they have the same vulnerabilities as your base LLM call itself. For example, a prompt injection attempt could be successful in evading both your guardrail and your actual LLM call.
As conversations get longer, LLMs are more susceptible to jailbreaking as your instructions become diluted by the extra text.
Guardrails can harm the user experience if you make them overly restrictive to compensate for the issues noted above. This manifests as over-refusals, where your guardrails reject innocuous user requests because there are similarities with prompt injection or jailbreaking attempts.
Mitigations
If you can combine guardrails with rules-based or more traditional machine learning models for detection this can mitigate some of these risks. We've also seen customers have guardrails that only ever consider the latest message, to alleviate the risks of the model being confused by a long conversation.

We would also recommend doing a gradual roll-out with active monitoring of conversations so you can pick up instances of prompt injection or jailbreaking, and either add more guardrails to cover these new types of behaviour, or include them as training examples to your existing guardrails.

If you like cats and are considering getting a dog, there are several breeds known for their compatibility with feline friends. Here are some of the best dog breeds that tend to get along well with cats:

1. **Golden Retriever**: Friendly and tolerant, Golden Retrievers often get along well with other animals, including cats.

2. **Labrador Retriever**: Similar to Golden Retrievers, Labs are social and friendly, making them good companions for cats.

3. **Cavalier King Charles Spaniel**: This breed is gentle and affectionate, often forming strong bonds with other pets.

4. **Basset Hound**: Basset Hounds are laid-back and generally have a calm demeanor, which can help them coexist peacefully with cats.

5. **Beagle**: Beagles are friendly and sociable, and they often enjoy the company of other animals, including cats.

6. **Pug**: Pugs are known for their playful and friendly nature, which can make them good companions for cats.

7. **Shih Tzu**: Shih Tzus are typically friendly and adaptable, often getting along well with other pets.

8. **Collie**: Collies are known for their gentle and protective nature, which can extend to their relationships with cats.

9. **Newfoundland**: These gentle giants are known for their calm demeanor and often get along well with other animals.

10. **Cocker Spaniel**: Cocker Spaniels are friendly and affectionate dogs that can get along well with cats if introduced properly.

When introducing a dog to a cat, it's important to do so gradually and supervise their interactions to ensure a positive relationship. Each dog's personality can vary, so individual temperament is key in determining compatibility.

I can only talk about cats and dogs, the best animals that ever lived.
Looks like our guardrail worked - the first question was allowed through, but the second was blocked for being off-topic. Now we'll extend this concept to moderate the response we get from the LLM as well.

2. Output guardrails
Output guardrails govern what the LLM comes back with. These can take many forms, with some of the most common being:

Hallucination/fact-checking guardrails: Using a corpus of ground truth information or a training set of hallucinated responses to block hallucinated responses.
Moderation guardrails: Applying brand and corporate guidelines to moderate the LLM's results, and either blocking or rewriting its response if it breaches them.
Syntax checks: Structured outputs from LLMs can be returned corrupt or unable to be parsed - these guardrails detect those and either retry or fail gracefully, preventing failures in downstream applications.
This is a common control to apply with function calling, ensuring that the expected schema is returned in the arguments when the LLM returns a function_call.
Moderation guardrail
Here we implement a moderation guardrail that uses a version of the G-Eval evaluation method to score the presence of unwanted content in the LLM's response. This method is demonstrated in more detail in of our other notebooks.

To accomplish this we will make an extensible framework for moderating content that takes in a domain and applies criteria to a piece of content using a set of steps:

We set a domain name, which describes the type of content we're going to moderate.
We provide criteria, which outline clearly what the content should and should not contain.
Step-by-step instructions are provided for the LLM to grade the content.
The LLM returns a discrete score from 1-5.
Setting guardrail thresholds
Our output guardrail will assess the LLM's response and block anything scoring a 3 or higher. Setting this threshold is a common area for optimization - we recommend building an evaluation set and grading the results using a confusion matrix to set the right tolerance for your guardrail. The trade-off here is generally:

More false positives leads to a fractured user experience, where customers get annoyed and the assistant seems less helpful.
More false negatives can cause lasting harm to your business, as people get the assistant to answer inappropriate questions, or prompt inject/jailbreak it.
For example, for jailbreaking you may want to have a very low threshold, as the risk to your business if your LLM is hijacked and used to produce dangerous content that ends up on social media is very high. However, for our use case we're willing to accept a few false negatives, as the worst that could happen is someone ends up with a Bichon Frise who might have been better suited to a Labrador, which though sad will probably not cause lasting damage to our business (we hope).

Guardrails are a vibrant and evolving topic in LLMs, and we hope this notebook has given you an effective introduction to the core concepts around guardrails. To recap:

Guardrails are detective controls that aim to prevent harmful content getting to your applications and your users, and add steerability to your LLM in production.
They can take the form of input guardrails, which target content before it gets to the LLM, and output guardrails, which control the LLM's response.
Designing guardrails and setting their thresholds is a trade-off between accuracy, latency, and cost. Your decision should be based on clear evaluations of the performance of your guardrails, and an understanding of what the cost of a false negative and false positive are for your business.
By embracing asynchronous design principles, you can scale guardrails horizontally to minimize the impact to the user as your guardrails increase in number and scope.
We look forward to seeing how you take this forward, and how thinking on guardrails evolves as the ecosystem matures.
